0;1310r8h;Are these stims or just weird habits?;My main one is picking at the skin around and under my fingernails. I use tweezers to pull the skin out from under them. It's often painful, but it's a kind of pain I like. I do this anytime my hands are not otherwise occupied. Waiting at a drive thru? Picking that skin. Avoiding chores? Picking for 20-30 min while watching YouTube videos on AuDHD or true crime. Sitting in the car line at my kids' school? That's the best time to pick because natural light makes it easier to see and grasp those tiny pieces of skin.  <newline>  <newline> The second one is chewing on my hair. It makes this crunching sound/ feeling that i LOVE. I don't eat the hair, I just destroy the hair that reaches to my mouth. The only way to prevent this is to keep my hair shorter than that.  <newline>  <newline> I am also ALWAYS moving my toes in my shoes in a sort of rhythmic pattern. It would be very hard to stop this, but it doesn't matter because no one sees me doing it.  <newline>  <newline> I rock forward and backward sometimes, but only when I'm really, really distressed and usually crying. Everything I read about stims seems to imply that if you don't flap your hands or rock on a daily basis, you're not really stimming. <newline>  <newline> What do you guys think? Do these qualify as stims or am I just a weirdo?;txgrl308;False;3;0.96;2023-04-27 18:11:43;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1310r8h/are_these_stims_or_just_weird_habits/;AuDHDWomen
1;12xenec;A lil bit confused (ADHD only or possibly AuDHD?) Lmk what you think?;"Helloooo I'm new here,, <newline>  <newline> I've been diagnosed with adhd about 1-2 years ago and it's kinda like ""ohhh"" and also the whole rollercoaster of what could have been etc- <newline>  <newline> So I got onto nd twitter and asked a bunch of stuff that kinda made me go ""thats a thing?!?"" <newline>  <newline> Anyway to my main point: sometimes I ask for advice or tips and stuff like that, and although I do know that not all methods will work for everyone, it always kinda seems like I can't relate as much as I ""should"" with adhders' advice, and at some point I was thinking maybe I also have autistic traits(? how do I term this :w:) especially after reading a few tweets that I relate really heavily with- (though again, it doesn't mean everyone's gonna have the same experience) <newline>  <newline>   <newline> I once read that the reasoning behind what you do/how you feel etc. Might be the little difference between adhd and autism because of the huge overlap, but I think for me I have some things that don't fit what ADHD seems? <newline>  <newline> For example,  <newline> -I have like arbituary rules for myself like I will not allow myself to use a pooled question and answer key to ""study"" (unless it's an official practice paper) and for reasons I don't know why, to the point that even when I'm desperate, I'd berate myself for not being able to ""break a dumb rule"" <newline> -I need routine, but I have to have someone in ""authority"" to set it for me because I will not listen to myself.

I hate not knowing what to expect it makes me kinda anxious <newline> -Idk if this counts: I need to do a thing correctly and properly so I need to know exactly what to do <newline>  <newline> Can't think of anything else rn.

4;12tap08;Is this what it feels to be non verbal?;Sorry already for any grammar and/or forming mistakes before hand:') <newline>  <newline> I was a couple of month ago diagnosed with ADHD at 20 years of age, and ever since then I've started to research more info about ADHD and autism. I've really started to suspect that I have high functioning autism as well, and just today I learned of something that would really point into that direction (and explain a lot of things) <newline>  <newline> In the past couple of days I finally truly understood what rejection sensitive dysphoria is, and that I most definitely have it, after seeing neurodivergent people talk about their experiences with it on TikTok and then doing some research about it on my own. <newline> That has now lead me into seeing videos from Audhd people describing how it feels to be non verbal and how it doesn't mean that you just cannot speak at all. And the way they talk about it relates really to my own experiences <newline>  <newline> In social situations, even if I was hanging out with my friends, it feels like a switch turns within me after a long interactions. I feel tired, it feels like I just don't have the energy to get the words out, I want to be part of the conversation but my head just feels blank. I can speak and give short replies if I need to, but I feel out of it and I either start daydreaming, overthinking and analyzing the entire conversation before as my brains are convincing that everyone hates me(pretty sure that's RSD) which makes me spiral into depression, or I'm just listening to the talking, maybe thinking about joining in but not participating. Sometimes it's the mix of all of those things. My brain just feels so full but empty at the same time? <newline> Sometimes I can bounce back from that state, but sometimes I need to excuse myself and leave because of feeling too tired and overwhelmed <newline>  <newline> All this also can be really easily triggered if I'm interacting with new people and my RSD pops up at the slightest hint of negativity. My mind just goes blank and I start spiraling and feel overwhelmed, if it happens in a group of people I can usually hide it pretty well and let other people speak, but whenever I'm speaking with one person I feel like my answers just take more time and I really need to process everything before I can speak. <newline>  <newline> Also whenever I'm in an argument, I'm angry or talk about something I'm intense/serious/passionate about I start to cry. I absolutely hate it because I want to talk and explain my points and views and my mind doesn't feel sad at all, but all that comes out are just tears and sobs. I can try to talk through it but then it gets too bad and I have to take breaks and collect myself before I can continue. Sometimes my whole body just tenses up and I start slightly shaking and my voice quivers but I can still talk <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I always thought that was just me being an ambivert and my social battery running out or that I'm just too sensitive, but hearing other people's experiences have made me question it. I figured that my possible autism symptoms were mostly just connected to not being good with social cues and I never considered that I actually might've had some non verbal moments or breakdowns <newline>  <newline> I have tried to google news and articles about this type of non verbal autism but as of now I haven't found anything, and I don't want to use Tiktoks as my only source of information on a topic like this. I'm going to autism diagnosis tests in the future, and if this is something worth bringing up I'd like to do that but in my country the understanding of neurodivergent people can be really outdated and I absolutely do not want to credit just TikTok on this incase I need to explain my symptoms and why I think I'm autistic to the doctor <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I don't know, maybe after all I am thinking way to deep into this? I'd be happy to hear if anyone has had similar experiences to this:'D;Mammoth_Invasion5;False;3;0.93;2023-04-20 18:31:45;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/12tap08/is_this_what_it_feels_to_be_non_verbal/;AuDHDWomen
5;12oxut4;good resources to help boyfriend understand AuDHD?;Hi all. I (24F) have been told by psychiatrists that I may have ADHD. I have done a TON of research on how ADHD and Autism presents in adult women and relate to almost everything posted here. After months, I finally have made an initial appointment to get evaluated.  <newline>  <newline> The problem is that I haven’t told my boyfriend. I guess I am nervous to tell anyone because I feel like they’ll doubt me since I’m not diagnosed? I would feel a lot better about telling people after the evaluation. The person evaluating me is well known for diagnosing adult women so I feel pretty confident that I will not be dismissed.  <newline>  <newline> I know I should open up this conversation with my boyfriend before my intake appointment in a week. I should have done it earlier and now it feels like I’m hiding this part of my life from him and I feel bad about that. I’m especially nervous because he’s been diagnosed with ADHD since he was a child and it definitely doesn’t present the same way. He’s mentioned that he finds it frustrating when people think they have ADHD after watching a few tiktoks. So I’m nervous he will think I’m doing the same, despite the fact that I’ve spent hours researching this (and have suspected ADHD for months and autism for over a year). He has been very supportive in the past so I think my fears are a bit irrational but I’m still nervous.   <newline>  <newline> I want to offer him some short, clear articles or quick videos that explain how ADHD/Autism tends to present in adult women. I’m not very good at explaining myself when I’m talking and it would really help to point him to some resources. The problem is I’ve done so much research that I don’t know what would be considered a good introduction and I do not want to overwhelm him.;qwerty12345678913;False;17;1.0;2023-04-17 02:05:30;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/12oxut4/good_resources_to_help_boyfriend_understand_audhd/;AuDHDWomen

8;12oi3h6;lack of support from family; <newline> hi friends! i just need to vent or relate. im currently diagnosed with adhd and generalized anxiety. as i’ve grown older, i’ve realized everything im experiencing could have been autism all along. my family is incredibly neurodivergent, the majority of my siblings and father are all diagnosed with adhd while my mom is undiagnosed but it’s clear as day she also has adhd. i do suspect my dad is on the spectrum.  <newline>  <newline> i’ve always struggled to get along with my immediate family. as a kid i felt so distant from my siblings and pretty much played by myself. i’ve gotten closer to them as we have grown into adults, but most of the time during family get togethers i feel like an alien. they always talk about work and most of the time i’m just sitting there with nothing to say because my life doesn’t revolve around work. but even outside of that, no one ever really asks what i’m up to or how my art or music is going. every time we go out somewhere, my opinion on anything means nothing and they’re always considering everyone else before me. i guess it doesn’t matter that much because i don’t really believe that blood means family, but i still have this feeling in my head like i can’t create boundaries between me and them. i’ve had a lot of feelings of wanting to cut them off completely. whenever i’m around them, i feel like i’m putting on this completely different version of me and im never fully comfortable to be myself. i even sometimes feel like i need to filter what i post on social media because im scared my siblings that follow me will judge me. this has even gotten to the point that i have one of my sisters blocked from seeing my instagram stories. it’s hard to explain, but i just know if i didn’t have to deal with my family so much that life would be a lot easier. yet, im in a position where i’m 25 working for starbucks and about to be going to school again so i kind of need a little support.  <newline>  <newline> im visiting with my family now and to just name a few examples, i’ve tried so hard to make my plans with my friends in the area around family plans, but of course no one can communicate effectively and they keep changing everything which really upsets me. when i vocalize this, everyone just tells me “you’ll be fine” <newline> they don’t understand me and whenever i try to speak up about my possible autism, they look at me like im insane and tell me i’m not.  i’ve even tried my best to explain why i get so upset or why i react certain ways and they don’t listen to me or start a completely different conversation. it almost feels like i don’t exist, which triggers my RSD.  <newline>  <newline> does anyone else experience issues with their families as well? if so, does anyone have any ideas on how to cope or deal with it without having to cut ties? i try so hard to cope with these problems and have a positive attitude, but they’re always putting me down no matter what, i think it really holds me back from my full potential.;blckzbth;False;4;1.0;2023-04-16 17:28:36;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/12oi3h6/lack_of_support_from_family/;AuDHDWomen
9;12kg2q2;My imperfect autism mythbusting tips on an autistic employment survey [CW: some harmful things/orgs commonly associated with autism];"I took a survey which featured a question about what I would share to counter stereotypes for the purpose of a hypothetical employee awareness training. The survey and initiative appears to be geared toward connecting autistic people with opportunities in skilled IT-type jobs, so that was the lens I wrote this from. It's late where I am and I am not thinking super clearly, but this is the list I came up with off the top of my head, trying not to overthink it. I thought I'd share! <newline>  <newline> Per sub rules, surveys aren't allowed, but if folks are interested, I can link the survey in the comments. I found it on LinkedIn because, you know, it's April. <newline>  <newline> \- All autistic people are different. If you know one, you know one. Just because your 10-year-old autistic nephew is really good at Hobby A or really enjoys Cartoon B doesn't mean that I do, too. <newline>  <newline> \-""Special interests"" are not childish - they are just one way we experience joy and some people even get PhDs in them. Some people also don't have special interests. <newline>  <newline> \- We are eight times more likely than neurotypical people to have a high IQ. Autism =/= intellectual disability, though sometimes autistic people have intellectual disability as well. <newline>  <newline> \- Our senses are heightened. This can sometimes be cool (we're more likely to experience synesthesia) but can often be overwhelming. If we tell you a sensory experience is uncomfortable or painful for us, please listen and believe us. Your unique experience of the world doesn't invalidate ours. <newline>  <newline> \- You may have heard of >!the organization Autism Speaks, ABA therapy, and the puzzle piece symbol!<. We consider these to be harmful. Please Google for more info as to why as there's a lot to unpack with each one. <newline>  <newline> \- Autism frequently co-occurs with ADHD (up to a 70% co-occurrence) so many of us have executive functioning challenges as well. <newline>  <newline> \- Contrary to popular belief, many autistic people feel emotions deeply, especially empathy and compassion. We can have a strong sense of justice and deep connection with pets and animals. We can also be highly creative and funny! This is thanks to our divergent thinking. <newline>  <newline> \- We can also be highly specialized in areas we're passionate about, and be highly productive when we're in hyperfocus. We're truly an asset to any team. We often make great leaders and managers as well! Yes, some of us can be extroverts! <newline>  <newline> \- Chances are you already know a handful of autistic people! Disclosing one's autism status is a personal choice and many don't feel safe doing so due to disinformation and commonly-held myths about autism and autistic people. Many people who are autistic might not know that they are, or might just be discovering that part of themselves. This is why the autistic community considers self-diagnosis to be valid. There are still many barriers to getting an official diagnosis, especially if you are a woman or racialized person. <newline>  <newline> \- If you want to learn more about autism, seek answers from the #ActuallyAutistic community. Before long, you'll unlearn everything else you thought you knew about autism and realize we're some pretty cool people to get to know and work with!";humanbehindthescreen;False;3;1.0;2023-04-13 07:28:09;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/12kg2q2/my_imperfect_autism_mythbusting_tips_on_an/;AuDHDWomen

I have absolutely no desire to go especially since I don’t want to exist and have been in “crisis mode” which is where all I want to do is run away, leave everything behind, be alone and start a new life. But I’m anxious to not go because I don’t want to seem lame or for them to think I don’t like them. And like he gets it but the fact that he told me originally he wanted a partner who would be social and hang out with his friends kinda screwed me up. He followed up saying he understands so I know he’s not holding it against me or anything but still now that’s in my head. I am an extrovert normally and I told him that but I don’t think he believed me- but he’s also only known me through burnout and I’ve been much less extroverted. I’m also not really into the same things as his friends so I feel like I’m having to mask that so I fit in :.: . It’s so embarrassing to feel like this at 25 but I’m so anxious over it but the thought of going makes me want to cry and I don’t foresee that changing. Why is everything so overwhelming and hard for no reason??;Thedailybee;False;5;1.0;2023-03-08 13:22:31;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/11lwab9/expectations_around_being_social_are/;AuDHDWomen

22;118mfp0;New to this whole world;"I only just got diagnosed with adhd a little less than a year ago. In all my years growing up, I never imagined that I would be diagnosed with adhd. Adhd was super hyperactive and excitable, right?  <newline>  <newline> Turns out I was very wrong. I had never really taken the time to look into it before the diagnosis, but my therapist told me ""I never told you because I thought you already knew. That's how obvious it was.""  <newline>  <newline> But it didn't end there. I found myself on tiktok and wound up on autismtok and found a few things that were similar and dismissed them, thinking ""I'm glad to know more about this, so I can better help my--oh... that makes sense."" I continued to look, talk to my therapist, question, take quiz after quiz (the official ones), and repeatedly got scores that fit right into the proper range. And that was before I started actually seeing the things I used to do that fit, but not quite.  <newline>  <newline> So, with time, I've wondered, I've questioned, I've considered official diagnoses, but canceled because I didn't want to bring my parents in.  <newline>  <newline> Then I discovered the comorbid symptoms of autism and adhd and things made a little more sense. <newline>  <newline> I *hate* routine, yet I need it, and once I have a routine, I hate breaking it.  <newline>  <newline> I used to think I never dealt in repetitive movements, but I started noticing all the things I did do: twisting while standing, moving back and forth in spinny chairs. Right now, I'm rubbing my legs together in circles. Leg bouncing. When I'm lying on my bed, I bounce my leg, so I rock a bit.  <newline>  <newline> When I first started looking into it, I never considered that I didn't like certain feelings or sounds or the like. Since, I started noticing things that bother me or that I particularly enjoy. And of course, I wonder if those things are all in the ""normal range"" of what bothers people.  <newline>  <newline> It took me far too long to be okay with mint toothpaste and I still can't stand cinnamon. Thumb joints are constantly feeling the need to be popped. They have for as long as I can remember, and it drives me insane. I never keep a wristwatch on me longer than a couple weeks because it is just uncomfortable. I've always had interesting choices in Socks and what kind of clothes to wear. And the list continues from there. I keep finding more and more things I do/used to do that would indicate a sensory trouble. Seeking or otherwise. <newline>  <newline> I've always known I struggle with people, but I used to think that it was because I read too much into them. But I'm starting to see all the rules and regulations I've put in place to navigate social relationships. ""Don't text too often."" ""People will care more about you if you ask them questions about the things they care about."" <newline>  <newline> There are some things that don't fit as well, too, and that's where the hangup is for me. I am not terrible at reading faces. I don't know if I have a specific special interest that I have delved super deep into, but then again, I am obsessed with dnd. I love space and science and do watch YouTube videos all the time. I just don't have the attention to do deep dive reading research.  <newline>  <newline> So, when I stumbled on audhd, I felt things started to make more sense to me. Because my adhd didn't fit exactly adhd and the symptoms of autism that were supposed to show up weren't so clear. Honestly, just reading a few of the questions and threads here resonated so much with me. <newline>  <newline> So, yeah. I'm still searching and hoping that this is the place that feels right and can help me find ways to work on myself and manage my needs.  <newline>  <newline> Thank you for reading my long-winded speech. <newline>  <newline> Tldr: I don't know what I'm doing, but audhd has felt the most right so far, so I'm here, hoping to learn and find a place with people who are like me.";Ms_LAMarigold;False;3;0.95;2023-02-22 02:26:13;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/118mfp0/new_to_this_whole_world/;AuDHDWomen

25;108c3fz;Social media is harder than it needs to be;Hi all! I love making art. I do it a ton but I struggle with social media.

But also the adhd makes it hard to keep to any strategies. I can’t keep a schedule to post, no one helps keep me accountable, and I just talk myself out of sharing all the time. I’ll post something I feel good about but by the next time I’m ready to share, I convinced myself it’s really scary. <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for.

26;107s85j;Went in for a screening came out degraded;Hi everyone! Just joined this community after having had a horrible experience in my first step towards diagnosis. (I apologise in advance as English is not my first language.)  <newline>  <newline> Background: <newline>  <newline> I [21F] have for the past year come over alot of Audhd content on tiktok that I have strongly sympathised with. For my entire life I have been told that I am weird and intense by friends and teachers. I have been bullied though did not realise until afterward when I was in therapy for suicide thoughts, stress and anxiety. This was 5 years ago now and I am in a much better place. Also of note, I keept myself to impossible standards for years and years. Keeping my focus on school sence friends were not at all a priority thus having almost straight A's for about 6 years. After that time I had 2 close friends.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> The screening: <newline>  <newline> So today I went in to my local health center where I had booked a screening for Autism and ADHD 2 months prior. Super stoked to finally begin this process I first filled in a general form in the waiting room about sleep, drugs and alcohol habits of the last 2 weeks. I generally feel that such forms are pretty unhelpful especially sence this was over Christmas and new year which are holidays and of course my habits aren't the same as when I am in school or working. <newline>  <newline> I get called in by the psychiatrist who quickly flip through the answers. Nothing of note except the question which was phresed along the lines of : 'Have you during the last two weeks sleepy less or more than usual?' And then you could fill in x many days of the week. I filled in all because sense I was not in school I could sleep in. She (the psychiatrist) asked if I was here for sleep problems to which I replayed 'No, I am not.' She then proceeded to ask whcish problems I had come in for. At this point I was confused. We were not on the same page at all. We went back and forth with the same question and answer a couple of times, both of us getting frustrated. 'What problem are you here for?' 'I am here for a screening for Autism and ADHD.' She then asked a bit my background which I gave the description above. At this sge looked really confused and asked : 'why have you come in if you exell at life? Why do you want a diagnosis?' To rich I replied : 'To be able to get help and be accepted by the community. And to understand myself better. Also Adhd can be managed with medication for focus. ' As I am sure all of you know masking and introspection play a part of Audhd. I did not under stad why she was asking me this. I also informed her of my 2 other diagnosises which have been proven to be linked to Adhd, - dyslexia and APD. She then asked why I wasn't diagnosed with this then since this is a condition you are born with. I told her that neither were diagnosed by a psychologist. She then asked that you need grounds to base the diagnosis on. I informed her that my nephew has been diagnosed with adhd. She seemed suspicious and asked about my parents. I told her that all of my siblings suspect that mom has Adhd and dad most certainly has autism. But since both are above 60 that a diagnosis would be rare. She then actually said to my face that my problems aren't real problems and that bering bullied is commonplace and that other people have it much worse than I do. She could send a referral but that it would get regected because I have not failed school and have friends and that it would be mor work for her than necessary. At this point I started to cry and she told me that I seemed disappointed. I politely thanked her for her time and said that she did nor have to send in the referral. I think she pitied me a bit and said the she could refer me to a colleague who specializes in Adhd but none at the centre had the knowledge about autism and the she had no experience in either. I was shocked, and declined then politely left. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Tbr: The psychologist in charge of me screening told me that my problems aren't problems and that I can't get diagnosed after which she confessed to not be a specialist in either autism or Adhd.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Have anyone else had this type of experience? <newline> Have you gone to private psychologists to get your diagnosis? <newline>  <newline> I am contemplating emailing my old psychologist and asking for advice and/or grounds for a referral. <newline>  <newline> How should I proceed? <newline>  <newline> Thanks for reading and any advice or encouragements!;namely_me_tte;False;11;0.95;2023-01-09 22:27:50;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/107s85j/went_in_for_a_screening_came_out_degraded/;AuDHDWomen
27;yo8txw;Help with ADHD + Autism?;"Hey guys, so for about 2 years now I've been suspecting I have ADHD and Autism.  <newline>  <newline> I've been suffering with crippling anxiety especially social anxiety for just about my entire life. Im 21 F and I've always questioned my behaviors but ever since 2019/2020 and seen Tiktok posts about ADHD and Autism I finally felt so heard. And the ADHD reddit community had made me cry so many times because its one of the only places I did not feel lonely.  <newline>  <newline> But of course I always think this ""phase"" will pass and I am just being a hypochondriac and that I am obsessing or focusing too much on it, and that I am just trying to act like I have it for attention or sympathy.  <newline>  <newline> But I have always felt different since I was a kid and the endless research, youtube videos and 2 years of debating I think it makes alot of sense to me. I constantly obsess and hyperanalyze every interaction of myself and I feel like I overstudy and analyze human interactions around me to try and fit in but I am an actor unfit for this part and it has been really hard to be someone I am not especially in this awful stage of my life. Of course this is not my only symptom. <newline>  <newline> My problems have only gotten worst as I got older and I am suffering in Nursing school because of it. <newline>  <newline> I've been prolonging the process to see a therapist for about year now. 2 months ago I made an appointment to see my schools therapist at ""no cost"" to me and at the end I got told that I just need to ""talk to people"" and ""take it day by day."" Like c'mon dude, thats the reason I'm still alive but I'm just trying not to feel like shit everyday while I am alive.  <newline>  <newline> So that was very discouraging to say the least. And I've found another one I want to see soon which I've been trying hard to find the courage to just dial the number and make an appointment.  <newline>  <newline> I am so sick of feeling like an imposter and not knowing who I am and feeling like my brain and my body are fighting all the time like I am two people and feeling like I have zero control over my thoughts and feelings when my brain is so logical. Its like my brain cannot convince my body to do commands. <newline>  <newline> Anyways, I've always wondered what the ADHD Autism commorbidity may look like especially in females because there doesnt seem to be much about it.  <newline>  <newline> And how does one go about asking about it to a therapist? I dont think I want to go in and the first thing comes out of my mouth being ""I think I have ADHD and or Autism"" but I also do not want to pretend I am there for just anxiety.  <newline>  <newline> I am also so scared that I am just going to sit there and mask and downplay my symptoms for show or internalized ableism (if I do have Autism/ADHD). Maybe thats why the first therapist downplayed what I said.  <newline>  <newline> And I am scared that it will just be childhood trauma I have endured through my development years between bullying and bad family relations, dynamics and how I was raised. <newline>  <newline>  And usually I would downplay myself saying oh it couldve been worst I that am ungreatful and I am just extra sensitive. <newline>  <newline>  But to think all my struggles in life and my identity(because I live to make everyone else happy but me) is all because of my childhood trauma which could cause these symptoms I can somehow relate to ADHD/Autism or point it that way is just crazy to me. Unless it is that which has exacerbated these childhood trauma experiences for me.  <newline>  <newline> I do not think getting a diagnosis would solve my problems but I think it can offer clarity and make me feel like I am not crazy and that my struggles are valid. I am almost certain I have ADHD because there is no way my brain makes me do, say, like and act the way that I do. But my internalized ableism calls myself lazy and full of excuses and a sympathy seeker. <newline>  <newline> Anyways, sorry for my tangents I just really would like anyone to share experiences of their own signs of AUDHD I call it and diagnosis experience. And if anyone can offer some tips for how to I guess ask about it or the process of being tested for these things. <newline>  <newline> I always feel like I need a script list of what to say because I am scared I will forget to say everything I need to or anything at all. And I dont know what is appropriate or not to say or ask and when to. Which again may be a factor as to why the first therapist told me ""tAkE iT dAy bY dAy""";Heelojeelo;False;5;1.0;2022-11-07 01:23:34;/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/yo8txw/help_with_adhd_autism/;AuDHDWomen

32;11msydz;Frustration rant (long read);"I (female) have wanted to get a diagnosis for a while so mentioned it to my doctor. She told me to fill out a questionnaire and make a list of symptoms so she could discuss it with me the next time. Today she called me back and asked why I hadn't filled out the questionnaire and handed it back to the practice. I was very confused because while I did remember her mentioning a questionnaire, I assumed she would go over it with me on the phone. As usual, I misunderstood what someone meant which meant I had to reschedule my phone appointment. Great evidence of autism but not great for much else. <newline>  <newline> So I went to the practice to pick up the questionnaire and when I looked at it I couldn't believe how short it was. Most of you in the UK have probably had to fill it out too. It was ten questions and you had to tick where you agreed or disagreed (mildly or strongly) with the statements. It infuriated me, not only because the doctor could have gone through it with me on the phone but also because the questions were so broad and hard to understand. Some questions were easy like ""I often notice small sounds when others do not."" That one is an obvious: ""strongly agree."" But the rest were not so easy. What does it really mean to be a ""big picture"" person vs a ""detail-oriented"" person? Not only that, but most of the questions were formulated as follows: ""I experience x when others do not."" Now please tell me how I am meant to know what other people experience? How do I know if I can read people ""correctly"" when no one ever tells me exactly how they feel? How the hell can I ""work out what other people are thinking"" by their facial expressions?! <newline>  <newline> Maybe this just confirms that I am autistic because I cannot give straightforward answers to these questions but I really feel this way of assessing people is all wrong. It's bureaucratic. It's a one-size-fits-all approach. I'm especially made because I know these kinds of questions are more tailored to males than females. I also believe that many neurotypical people would also struggle to answer these questions accurately because there is no part where you can ""justify your answer."" I could say that I believe I'm good at reading facial expressions because I've never been told otherwise and this makes me believe I must be doing alright. A neurotypical person could say likewise. <newline>  <newline> I calculated my score and in the end I scored 7 out of 10, high enough to be referred for a diagnosis. I purposefully didn't cheat on the test by reading how to get a high score, despite worrying that I might not ""pass"" (ironic, I know). I repeatedly score high on the apsie quiz (which is far more comprehensive) and definitely relate to a lot of female autistic Youtubers. And I had written loads of notes about things I experienced in childhood that would definitely be more helpful to someone wondering if I am autistic. I'm just very frustrated at the way we adults have to go about getting a diagnosis.

37;10f1ssc;A Day in the Life: showing what normal means for Neurodivergent people;"I've seen quite a few ""day in the life"" posts on tiktok recently and it made me feel quite isolated. Obviously the influencer one was unattainable, but there's been a few by ""normal average"" women, and the amount of things they do in a day... I know its probably at least partially scripted specifically to make them look batter but it still really made me reflect on the difference between me and them. <newline>  <newline> Then when I shared that post the other day about comparing ourselves to a Neurotypical normal, it made me realise that all my life I've been told ""don't use your (diagnosis) as an excuse"" and still expected to hit those same milestones as everyone else.  <newline>  <newline> So, I want to ask you all, if you feel comfortable, share what an average day looks like for you. Share what normal is for you - warts and all. You can record and vlog and post the link, take pictures and share those, or write a text post.

38;10dsono;Ever doubt that you’re ND and then bam! it hits you?;Probably not the best title but it was all I could come up with lol. <newline>  <newline> I have moments where I think “hmm, maybe I’m not actually ND and just imagined it or was having a blip” but then a bunch of stuff happens and I think “ah yes, there it is!”. <newline>  <newline> Like tonight, I went to change into my favourite pyjama top and couldn’t find it anywhere. I *know* I left it on the bed, next to my pillow. Turns out my partner did laundry today and I’m assuming my top is in there. He can’t even tell me for sure and I wanted to scream “how can you not know what you’ve put in the washing machine?” (He finds it amusing that I can track my things, down to knowing when I’ve got socks missing). I could feel myself get very stressed and upset, I was crying and freaking out because I hadn’t planned on changing tops tonight and it smelled good and felt nice. I feel absolutely ridiculous for having such a massive reaction to it too. Like I’m an adult, I shouldn’t have such an extreme reaction to what was a reasonable situation. <newline>  <newline> I’ve been doing a core challenge thing through Apple Fitness+ and been enjoying the routine, except tonight I didn’t get to do it or do anything I usually would after work and it’s completely thrown me. Came up to bed at 8pm just because I feel so uncomfortable, lost and like I want to scream, and it’s bothering me. Yes, there is probably enough floor space for me to do it up here but for some reason I can’t just do that because it’s not what I’d planned. <newline>  <newline> I’ve also been coming home exhausted and feeling like I have no mental capacity left, wondering why, til I saw a post on instagram that was a reminder that ND people struggle with transition and change. I’ve recently had some changes at work - new team, new line manager, new shift pattern, new location, new responsibilities. I saw the post and honestly I laughed because of how obvious it was after that. <newline>  <newline> Anyone else had a similar thing?

39;xat8lo;"""Why is your autism diagnosis important to you? It's not like there's any medication or treatment you could have, like with your ADHD?""";"I'm sure we've all heard some variation of this question? This was a direct quote from my GP when I asked to be sent for an autism evaluation last week since the NHS is refusing to recognise my existing autism and ADHD diagnosis from a local charity (performed by someone who is literally hired by the NHS to perform these evaluations).   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> It's not the first time I've heard this question either. When I first suspected I had ADHD and Autism, I told a one or two people - a very close friend and my closest family. They all agreed I definitely sounded like I matched the criteria once they got over their stereotyped ideas of what those diagnosis where, however they didn't understand why I would **want** to be diagnosed. <newline>  <newline> At least with the ADHD they could understand that getting medication might help me, but they could see absolutely no benefit to, in their mind 'admitting to a deficit'.  <newline>  <newline> ... <newline>  <newline> Today, [I saw this video on tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@courtneymermaid/video/7141499280744910085?_r=1&_t=8VZQfMsei73&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7141499280744910085) and it's like a lightbulb went off in my head. I finally know how to explain it, because explaining to them about the exhaustion of masking hasn't been effective - but then they've only ever known the people pleasing masked version of me, and I still haven't been able to break that down very much beyond forgiving myself for an emotionless face, hating small talk, loving to info dump about my special interest, and giving myself permission to reinvest time and energy into old interest I had previously forced myself to give up as ""too childish"". <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> The reason we want a diagnosis has nothing to do with wanting a cure, or treatment. We want validation. We want to know why we feel this way. We want to not be alone anymore. We want to find others like us. <newline>  <newline> I cannot tell you how much joy being in an autistic friendly community has brought me, I'm literally crying as I type this. <newline>  <newline> This feeling of belonging, of not being the odd one out anyone - it's what we craved for so long - when we have been ""othered"" our whole lives. <newline>  <newline> I don't need fixing. I just needed to be seen as whole. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I hope the criteria for diagnosis continues to develop, and is eventually able to recognise us much younger so we don't go unnoticed for so long.

They may still partake in their interest in a smaller, or less pressured way <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> \## Worthlessness/Guilt <newline>  <newline> Feeling guilty or worthless is an element of Depression. There is a strong element  of self-loathing. VS In Autistic Burnout this is more of a guilt around not being able to complete day-to-day obligation. This may be accompanied by confusion, and a continued desire to do them, and attempts to do them, but not ever being able to fully complete them <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> \## Changes in Cognition <newline>  <newline> People who are Depressed may feel slowed down and may find it hard to concentrate.

41;134bp33;(TW:Sexual assault and victim blaming) Sometimes I hate other women;Spoiler'd just in case  <newline>  <newline> A couple of days ago I was sexuallly assaulted by a guy I had just met. I was cornered in a bathroom(he literally blocked the only exit)and forced to kiss him while he hugged me and started kissing my neck.  It was a gross experience but something that has happened so many times I've grown numb to it.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I live in a very conservative and extremely backwards society that thrives on men (and women) treating rape and sexual assault like jokes. It's considered 'cool' here for guys around my age (I'm 22) to harass women into sex and attempts to change it is either laughed off or completely ignored once the initial outrage dies off.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Men on Trinidad (where I live) are almost actively encouraged to be trash.  Being autistic and a woman sucks because you miss all the red flags before it's too late and people assume you're flirting when you're just trying to be nice. I'm also pretty energetic, lack a filter and give off 'pixie dream girl' vibes.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> But that's not the issue here. When I was venting in a discord server I was a part of, one of the other girls turned my experience into a all cis hetero men are evil rant. To which I corrected her that 1. Her rant was misandrist and 2. American values and culture is much different to what I exprieance here in Trinidad and that I don't appreciate her turning my experience into fuel for her own agenda. Personally, I don't blame and fear any guy for what has happened to me. Can't cast all the blame on men when the women here actively encourage this bullshit. Also I'm just too lazy to hold all that hate, takes too much effort to assume every guy that approaches me in a friendly manner is actually out to get me. Why should I give up my kindness because of other people's shit?  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Her response: To tell me that as long as I continue to trust men, I'm begging to be assaulted again.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Sometimes, I really hate other women. Like perhaps I'm missing something but who says that to someone talking about their own sexual assault. Who thinks that's ok to say? This is not the first time I've faced victim blaming and it's always from other women. Sometimes women are so fucking awful I'd rather be  in a room full of guys than a room full of women.  The most supportive people I've ever been around has been men. Everytime I'm in a women only space, everytime I start talking about my own experiences, I can't seem to escape the victim blaming and 'socially acceptable' sexism.  No, I will not stop trusting men. No, I don't think that all cis hetero men are evil beings who only want to hurt women. It's sexism and I refuse to even be casually sexist. I've experienced both the good and the bad and I simply choose to believe in the good.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> But I just keep getting the same victim blaming bullshit from 'progressive' women only spaces. That I'm a 'pick me' or I deserve to be assaulted because I don't believe in sexist bullshit. I really fucking hate hate women sometimes. Because even the same people who preach uplifting other women are just as quick to tear down other women to feel good as those who don't.  <newline>  <newline> Or maybe I'm just tired and letting my emotions get the better of me. This is the most likely option here lol;imonlybr16;False;2;1.0;2023-05-01 03:43:03;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/134bp33/twsexual_assault_and_victim_blaming_sometimes_i/;autisminwomen
42;133t7ps;mean girl friends when self realizing;"Hi, I'm having a sad morning. Yesterday I opened up to my friend about how i've been learning about autism and using tools and techniques I've learned from doing so to help me feel better. I had brought it up to her before and she basically told me to stop because that's ridiculous, everyone is diagnosing themselves with autism, etc. This time I told her ""look you can laugh at me if you want but learning about autism is helping me learn what I need to do to take care of myself in all seriousness"" <newline>  <newline> To my face (via text) she was accepting of it, said she supports whatever I need to do, blah blah blah.  <newline>  <newline> I woke up this morning and saw her insta story, where she posted: <newline>  <newline> ""the amount of people that self diagnose themselves with adhd and autism thru tiktok and then suddenly think that everything is ableist in accessible to them bc of that is rly mind blowing. like missing a dmv appointment, blaming it on ur adhd and then saying the dmv is ""inaccessible to ppl with adhd"" like girl WHAT?"" <newline>  <newline> This feels like such a mean girl trap. I know because she's done it to me before. In high school she literally wrote a song about me when she was mad at me and posted it on youtube, included exact quotes from me and then told me it wasn't about me and basically gaslit me about it.  <newline>  <newline> So I'm at a loss. I don't know how to confront her about this because I know she just thinks I'm being ridiculous in the first place.

47;131k76d;showers/baths as stims?;"When I began college and lived in a dormitory for my first two years, I found myself frequently heading to the showers to calm down and avoid over-stimulation (from obnoxious and never-ending sounds from hall mates, the general presence of having to live with a mask on constantly because I was forced to have a roommate, over-stimulation resulting from the messiness of my roommate and the invasion of her items into my space, etc.). Often, I wouldn't even actually bathe in the shower when I went in to calm down, but would run the water for up to an hour, let it warm me up, listen to the sounds of the water, and just be finally alone from everyone. I would sometimes do this multiple times on a particularly overstimulating day. Now I live in an apartment by myself in which I can at least unmask at the end of a day, yet I find myself doing a similar thing but with baths, where the act of listening to the water fill the tub and touching the water as it comes out of the drain is more calming than actually sitting in the tub of hot water. My water is included with my rent, and so it is technically not an extra cost for me to do this, but I try to not do it too often as to not waste water and energy. However, on bad days or super overstimulating days, I find myself sometimes taking multiple ""baths"" where I enjoy hearing and feeling the water flow the very most, and then sit in the hot water while doing assignments or whatnot, even just watching YouTube until I can't take the heat anymore. And then perhaps I'll repeat it a few hours later if I am still feeling overwhelmed. Is this stimming?

52;12zyao2;Insecurity and abandonment issues ruining my relationships. Am I just too toxic for anybody?;"34F with autism, currently NEET and very much homebound due to physical and mental health issues. Sorry for the long post incoming. (TW, mentions very briefly what some really bad men did online.)  <newline>  <newline> My anxiety these days is very high and I need help. Basically I don't have any ""constant"" friends and all I'm left with are a bunch of not-so-close friends who pop up every few days. I used to have one irl bff who hung out with me often and kept me connected to the outside world. Lost him late 2020 when he got a gf who wouldn't let him talk to his female friends. Just like that, our years of close friendship went down the drain, and I had to start over from scratch. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> After that, I tried connecting with people online and got attached to a few who each turned out to be liars pretending to be what they're not. One or two of which go on this site to pick up girls often. At least the one I'm sure of, we met on Reddit and went on a mental health Discord server together. Later on, it became apparent that the server owner guy was flirting with the female members, and those women mysteriously left one by one. What made it quite obvious was that even moderators were leaving. But I was slow on the uptake and had fallen for him before I did my research (I wanted to commit in a major way so I had to background check) and discovered that his stories and explanations didn't add up. I even invited some friends to the server to observe what was going on and my suspicions were affirmed and later on confirmed by how the server owner reacted to some questions from the members. <newline>  <newline> Another guy I got interested in did not message me often. We met at a fan club server of my favorite rapper. It always had a horrible effect on me when I felt close to someone and then they communicate only sporadically. The few times we were able to talk were magical. And then poof, gone. Anxiety levels up, abandonment issues up. Only I loved and trusted this guy, and the only time I could let go was when I heard from one of the mods (I already left the server we were in, it was too spammy for me) that this guy was a pedophile and was caught hitting on a younger friend of ours who was still a minor. When he had told me he was interested in older women like me. He had said all the right things to make me fall in love with him, and I needed reality to hit me that hard to wake me up from my delusions. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> That brings me to my latest person... She reached out to me here on Reddit while I was in one of my lowest lows and was interested in being friends as she said she could relate and didn't have friends either as a hikikomori (shut-in or socially withdrawn). I couldn't believe my lucky stars, she's so cool with all the hobbies and stuff. She's physically attractive and quite brilliant mentally as well. But at that point my insecurity and doubts lingered. Surely she has other friends. Surely our friendship doesn't mean half as much to her as it does to me. Surely I'm not good enough. Surely she could leave me anytime. <newline>  <newline> She wasn't a regular texter either, so that added to my separation anxiety and abandonment issues. I liked her a lot and enjoyed our time together but I was subconsciously refraining from trusting or falling in love. Which meant that I was downgrading everything with my doubts. I did not let myself enjoy too much because I'll get too attached. I wouldn't let myself fall. Except after 7 months, I really did fall and had to face the onslaught my feelings. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I was sure she would leave me if she knew I was in love with her, that I wanted more than friendship. So I blocked her. That hurt her, so I tried to reach out and explain. She accepted my explanation. I told her I wanted and needed her. She said she wanted and needed me too, that the time I'd blocked her made her realize that. That made me happy, which made me insecure all over again. And our dynamic did not change. She texted rarely and would disappear for days, which means I was pining most of the time. I fought with her again and again, demanding attention, validation, reassurance, affection... a ""real"" relationship. <newline>  <newline> She said that she's unable to be romantic with any human. That she'd been isolated for so long and is used to being alone with her gaming and art. That it doesn't mean she doesn't value me, but she can't have a normal friendship or relationship with me. I was furious. I would be cool with it if she liked someone else, but I lost to a video game! She said she wants to be ""just friends"" but I wanted to explain, ""just friends"" is more demanding and complicated than ""lovers"". Friends check up on each other often and have to follow certain social rules. Lovers get a free pass to unmask because there's an understanding that you belong to each other. I could live with her disappearances if we were in a romantic relationship. But if it were friendship, I need more regular communication. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I got really confused and my separation anxiety and abandonment issues were through the roof at that point. I was so angry that I questioned her feelings for me. I accused her of leading me on, of being the same as the guys that went before who only pretended to be interested. That only hurt her as she didn't fight back but gave up. She said she might as well be dead to me, if I think she's the same as those manipulative normies that take advantage of people like us who have mental issues. She had been true to me all along, and I had to destroy everything we've built over several months just because of my insecurity and unmet emotional needs. <newline>  <newline> I was already aware that I made a huge mistake as soon as I said those awful things to her. But I couldn't take them back. It seems I'm blocked now. And I know those things that happened in the past won't excuse me for what I've done. I'm a terrible person who drives the good persons away. But what can I do when I need feedback to know I'm not always some monster who destroys friendships? I can't hold a job, I am not good enough at anything to have hobbies, and I'm so depressed I can hardly feel any joy. I have nothing to offer her or anyone who could be friends with me. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I am so lonely and aside from her, everyone I met who seemed to be interested in me were fake. And I have to keep masking until someone lets me in and we feel safe with each other. It is exhausting to go back to meeting random people and doing small talk. I'm autistic, I need my structure, I need a constant in life and I can't even have that. I need someone I can be myself with, and I'm not allowed to have that because I'm insecure to the point of being toxic... <newline>  <newline> What can I do?

53;12zv00t;Unfortunate roommate experiences;So I don’t know if I’m just extra naive and didn’t see red flags until it was too late / went to a Christian college so most of the people there were nuts in the first place and it was considered normal lol  <newline>  <newline> But I have had 6 terrible living situations either due to roommate or one time a landlord.  <newline>  <newline> Most recently, I let a long time college friend stay at my apt in another city since I moved away and I was only charging her $400 for one bedroom in a regularly $1625 apt. The other bedroom is mine and I have a ton of my belongings in there.  <newline>  <newline> I did it as a favor for her because she was saying how she’s doing an internship and does not make a lot of money. My kitchen things are still there and I know as far as I told her she could use that, but I never agreed to her using my other things.  <newline>  <newline> The first weird event was when she sent me a Snapchat video of her and her bf, I thought the video was weird and repeatedly watched it until I realized those are my wall decorations behind them and they were ON MY BED!  <newline>  <newline> She said that they were high and running around the apartment. Still totally not okay and weird and is she said she wouldn’t do it again.  <newline>  <newline> Fast forward to me coming into town. She nickel and dimed my bf for $5 gas station drink (when he paid for dinner and smoked her out). Afterwards I find out her bf is basically living there (has his Xbox there) they’ve used up my dish pods, cleaning supplies were taken from under the sink in my private bathroom, took an hdmi cord from my room, fucked up one of my peach squishies (psychopath shit like cut a slit into it?!). Basically they were using my room as a second room for them to use.  <newline>  <newline> She lied to my face about all of it and literally said “I’m not trying to gaslight you or lie to you” like no that’s exactly what you are doing. Also grossed out like what if her bf is going into my room when she’s not there all of my personal things are in there. It’s beyond disrespectful. <newline>  <newline> I gave her until end of the month and she ended up leaving immediately.

58;12yh7ut;My boyfriend is constantly on his phone, I feel frustrated and sidelined, need help communicating this.;Posted this on r/relationshipadvice but thought some more likeminded people might have good advice. <newline>  <newline> I live with my boyfriend, we’ve been together just over a year. He works 9 hours, I work 6 and am studying to start university. Whenever there’s a break in whatever’s going on, I find that my boyfriend is on his phone, scrolling through Facebook. He works from home 3 days a week doing software development, and I know he scrolls Facebook while waiting for tests to run etc. as well, so the issue isn’t that he doesn’t have time during working hours to be on his phone. <newline>  <newline> Getting ready to go out the door I’ll just run back to turn the lights off or something and I turn around and he’s lying on the bed on his phone. We went on holiday last week and instead of being outside in the sun (we live in England, sun is a rarity for us) or at least looking through the massive number of books available there, he sat in the dark on his phone (for about an hour at a time). I asked why he wasn’t at least sitting outside and he said the sun was too bright for him to see the screen.  <newline>  <newline> I try to talk to him at times and just get short responses or grunts. When I say hey, like if you weren’t on your phone we might be having a conversation right now, or you could be doing something more meaningful, I get shut down. I think he thinks that if I want a conversation then I can just start it while he’s still using his phone, but that just doesn’t work. No matter how open you think you are to it, being on your phone and not looking up when talking is just a bad setup for a conversation. I just feel like the opportunity isn’t there and the entertainment I provide is second to that provided by his phone. I’m lonely and I don’t have friends I see other than him.  <newline>  <newline> My issue with it is in two parts, one being that I feel sidelined by this behaviour and two being that I’m frustrated by its meaninglessness, mindlessness. I’m aware that might come across as snobbish and that I shouldn’t be telling him what to do with his time, especially when I have a lot to improve on myself. <newline>  <newline> I just don’t know what to do about it, I feel like it’s making our relationship worse but I can’t communicate to him why it’s such a big deal for me. I’m also the only one that brings up issues and opens up in the relationship and I feel like I’m whining at him too much. We just feel so distant from each other and that just makes it harder to actually get across what’s up.;bestialsmallpenguin;False;7;0.72;2023-04-25 11:57:35;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12yh7ut/my_boyfriend_is_constantly_on_his_phone_i_feel/;autisminwomen
59;12yeumo;Idk if I’m actually autistic;I’m 21, non binary but afab. TW: mentions self harm.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was about 11, this is when panic attacks started. I was always smart and talkative in primary and high school, but always struggled with friendships because I felt I was “weird”. I was always good at (still am) at languages and writing. I’m now studying anthropology and doing quite well. In high school I became a lot more introverted, where i was extremely extroverted before. In and out of depressive episodes, i was a consistent self harmer between the ages of 14-18, and only in my first year of uni was I able to access mental health help, through my university’s facilities. I was put on antidepressants for six months then in my second year, referred to a psychiatrist at my uni. We talked maybe for 3 months or so and I told her I thought maybe my depression and anxiety were undiagnosed adhd related, because I struggled SO BADLY with time management and motivation for school but I also read 3 books about mycology and have now memorised so many South African species of mushroom. She sent me a survey for adhd and autism in adult women. I answered it, saw how many symptoms I actually presented, and never sent it. I ghosted her and now I’m in my third year at uni, and haven’t seen any help for just over a year. I deactivated Instagram also because of a very prevalent “I have autism” trend I kept seeing. I didn’t wanna be that person to self diagnose but the more I learn about autism in adult women, the more I think I’m on the spectrum.  <newline>  <newline> ANYWAY, that’s all just context. Last night my bf and I decided to try this new thing where we wake up at 5:30am and just get mad productive so that by the time he goes to work and I go to uni, we both have so much done. (We don’t live tg) I got up at 5:30, did the first few things on mine, only to then end up falling asleep during my meditation. I woke up, realised I missed so much time in my schedule and had a bad panic attack where I kept hitting my head with my fists. I had zero control in that moment. I pulled myself out of it with a meditation on my breaths. I told my mom about it (I stayed home today) and asked her if she thinks I might be autistic. She said “they want you to think that you are but you aren’t. I also read the symptoms and relate but it’s stuff you grow out of and learn to stop.” I mentioned the concept of masking and she said that she thinks I’m normal, I just need to grow out of these habits of panicking when things don’t go my way.  <newline> I don’t know how to feel right now.

60;12y80o0;How do I deal with extremely anger and desire of revenge against some who manipulate and steal from me?;"I usually pretty calm and, you know, like a ""whatever"" predisposition to everyone around me, even if they try to hurt me emotionally or pretend to mock me. But I find myself completely angry when I see someone mistreat others, and I get furious if that same person is telling lies about everything. <newline> So last year I met this guy who presented himself as an ""autistic queer man, who prefers to be called she"" and he was kinda activist for the neurodivergent and autistic people, when he started to call for people for working in a new agency for only neurodivergent... gods I couldn't stop myself, so I sign in. <newline> The hell came after 3 months of hard work, he was quite am, he always needed something, at every hour, and always had a deadline.

Using the ""I'm so burn out leave alone"" thing that I started to feel guilty about it, so I quit, and leave. <newline> 2 months later I find out that he abused the whole team, telling lies about him giving me all the money, and lie about me leaving the work without doing nothing. Also, he groomed, love boomning and even sexual assault one of our team youngest coworkers (he's 39, she's 21). <newline> When we try to reach him he dessapear. <newline> Now, after four months, he came back on TikTok and continues he's ""autistic activism"" as if nothing happens!  <newline> I'm so angry, and mad, he run away with more than 5k USD, after raping a girl, and grooming lots of more girls.

61;12xs7ze;Tips about eating as autistic woman;First of all, very slight warning - if anyone is struggling with ED or mental health issues related to food I will be mentioning weight loss but I think in a healthy perspective. <newline>  <newline> Hi :) <newline>  <newline> I recently confirmed my suspicions as my autism assessment confirmed I am in fact autistic. That helped me a lot with validating my feelings and struggles. One thing that has always been a huge struggle is food. A lot of sensory issues and the society with their pressure on women and girls and their wight didn't help with my relationship with food. <newline>  <newline> That leads us to the fact that I am definitely plus size **which alone is not something negative** but I got some health issues related to that like too high blood sugar, insuline resistance, troubles with my joints. And for me personally it's not very good that i hyperventilate after 2 flights of stairs or that i feel sleepy all the time. Sometimes I also don't feel good specifically with my looks but as I said, it's not the most important. <newline>  <newline> I do want to loose weight because I do not feel healthy and doctors confirmed it but in my country autism is not something very well researched so they were not able to provide a lot of help accomodating autistic needs. I also want to loose weight because I do not feel capable of doing things I like and I do not like how my body looks (mostly because of proportions). <newline>  <newline> That all being said, most of the advice I've received in my life was to just change my diet. The point is I don't know how. Eating foods that are outside of my comfort zone is exhausting in the long run and it makes me have so little energy for functioning that I end up with more safe (bu unhealthy) food than not.  <newline>  <newline> Do you know some sources for inspiration about food for neurodivergent people, especially women? Some tips and tricks etc. Might be Tiktok accounts (preferable), Youtube, subreddits, other platforms. Of course I would also love to hear your tips and tricks if you've found something that worked for you :) <newline>  <newline> I really hope I didn't say anything offensive to anyone because it was definitely not my intentions.;EtherealRusalka;False;2;0.67;2023-04-24 18:45:33;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12xs7ze/tips_about_eating_as_autistic_woman/;autisminwomen

63;12x07ov;Am I unlovable?;THIS IS VERY LONG!!!! <newline>  <newline> This may sound dramatic but I think I might be unlovable. I am autistic and everyone who I consider a friend knows this. I am also black (this is important to the perspective of the story). Recently I went to my senior prom. Last year my friends planned a sleepover for after prom and I’m pretty sure everyone had a good time. This year, they had a completely separate after party and “somehow” I didn’t know. We have a big group chat with everyone who was at the party and me so it’s not like nobody could have informed the group about it in a quick way. I only found out through Instagram posts that this happened.  <newline>  <newline> One of the attendees was a friend of mine since 6th grade who claims “she thought I knew” which I find suspicious. The reason why this mess is important to my autism and blackness is because I’m now the only black person in the group of mostly white people. I’m also the only autistic person. This isn’t an isolated incident, but it was the final straw. I’ve seen other autistic women talk about how their Neurotypical counterparts are off-put by them and eventually drift away. It’s not like I’m looking for Neurotypical acceptance, but any other autistic people around me are white and don’t understand the full struggle I’m going through. Or generally, we don’t fit well together. This adds to the feeling of isolation. I feel so alone.  <newline>  <newline> This happens again and again and I don’t think I will ever have any real friends. Is this true? I know realistically it’s not, and this may seem very juvenile to some but I have never had any connection deeper than surface level with people my age. I’m afraid that I will never have true friends. At this point, it has to be me because it wouldn’t happen so often if it wasn’t me. I’m very funny and nice and I know a lot about many interesting things. I was prom royalty (meaning I was nominated for prom queen and didn’t win but still got a decent amount of votes) so I know I’m not unpopular or anything like that.  <newline>  <newline> Honestly, I didn’t know I was up for prom queen until I got there because I didn’t know I was nominated and I still don’t know who nominated me. All of that to say that it’s not like I’m not trying to leave a good impression. It seems like all the sincere efforts I put into relationships with others always goes to waste.

66;12v80f6;Does anyone else not really fit into online autism communities?;I'm thinking of, like, Twitter and Instagram. On Reddit a lot of the different communities are divided into different subreddits so I can pretty much just avoid the ones that I don't really fit in with, but I feel like Reddit is also a little less... I'm not sure what the term is, but I think even if you get into a disagreement with somebody, you're less likely to be canceled or ostracized, whereas especially on Twitter that's a problem. <newline>  <newline> I can't currently think of any examples, but I've been thinking about this recently because a lot of people in autism communities are a very blunt and not all of them know what they're talking about. Sometimes people spread information that appears scientific and then you find out later that there's actually no backing for whatever they're claiming, but if you push back then they attack you. That kind of thing. I don't know, it just feels like another thing that I have to mask in. I often felt like I had to mask in these spaces and like I had to pretend to be someone I'm not, and it kind of sucked, because disagreements would not just be disagreements, they could quickly blow up into something huge, and also Twitter moves so quickly and it was stressful. If somebody got canceled for a bad take or called out, people would expect you to make a decision on how to feel or to unfollow or block them within a few hours maybe, and they would start questioning you if you didn't, even though my brain doesn't work that fast and I'm reluctant to make that decision when I don't have all of the information. People are also seemingly obsessed with morality and I saw so many times when somebody was popular in communities and then somebody found out something bad they did ages ago and all of a sudden they were ostracized, or people would basically do what they could to become famous so that they're bad takes were more hidden, I guess? It makes it hard to know who to trust. <newline>  <newline> Obviously being a good person is important, but it feels like in some of these communities, it doesn't really matter if you're a good person, so much as if you agree with everything that the most prominent members of the community say. I also know on Twitter that there was an issue where a certain large account would go around attacking smaller accounts or accounts run by people of colour and put them on blast. However, because they shared a bunch of tweets other people could relate to, they had tons of followers and other people really liked them, even though when I looked into their account, a lot of their stuff didn't really seem to have scientific backing, or even if they were talking about some kind of scientific paper or whatever, they might have misinterpreted the situation. Or they would write like a gigantic tweet thread on something and it wouldn't make much sense but if you tried to clarify, they would attack you for that. <newline>  <newline> I don't know if this makes sense, but if it does - anyone else? I don't really want to hang out in spaces where I feel like I have to act like everybody else, because then I might as well just hang out with neurotypicals.;turnontheignition;False;17;0.97;2023-04-22 14:43:41;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12v80f6/does_anyone_else_not_really_fit_into_online/;autisminwomen

70;12tucky;So I think I might be autistic;"Disclaimer: please excuse the word vomit. This post might make sense or might not. <newline> 34 F. I think I might be autistic and not officially diagnosed. Ive always been different and weird. I have R. B. F. and I'm constantly being asked if I'm mad, or sad and whats wrong. But I'm just chilling and litrally resting my face. Ive never been good at making friends or keeping them. I'm bad at social ques. There are some social interactions I've had that finally clicked and I realize the other person was flirting or trying to connect with me. I take things litrally and I'm overtly direct and straight to the point. I also make it a point to tell my partner please be clear & direct with me. Otherwise I'm not gonna get it.I have moments where I am physically overloaded and can't stand any noise or outside stimulie. As a child I remember having huge melt/shutdowns over simple things. Being asked to read outloud, doing reading challenges. Ive thrown a book accross a classroom. Being stubborn, being unmoved by logic and rational. Ive screamed at a playground because to many kids surrounded me.  Adults who knew me as a child, have told me you were never a touchy feely kid, you always did your own thing,  never sought out physical affection. I remember having a favorite shirt as a kid I would constantly wear, because the texture felt good and I still seek out clothes with the same texture (like super soft and feels light.) I was content in never leaving my room and my friends always came to me. Got me outside. I was a follower. I always went along with whatever. Later they would tell me, you never sought me out, its always felt one sided. Which is valid, I didnt think to seek out. I didnt understand I had to do that. But this friend group was chalk full of childhood trauma and we all manifested it in drastically different ways. So it was a trauma-bond friendship. <newline>  <newline> Over the last year I've reading autistic books, audio books, articles, youtube videos and tiktoks. Ive been seeking out and learning information. And ive been relating to it. It's kinda clicked. Ive tried talking to my partner about it. But they kind of  just blown it off and said to the effect of ""no, your not."" So I havent really talked to anyone about it since. But I can't shake it. To many things are lining up. I mean I can go into more detail. I know and understand that I can be totally wrong. <newline>  <newline> I'm gonna stop here. Its late and my phone is dying.

76;12rrttq;Being autistic seems to always be an inconvenience to the outside world vs our inner world.;If you know or dont know, a tiktok went viral of a person in NYC who is autistic, and has OCD.

They don’t like to be touched (contamination OCD) they are also hard of hearing, not from the US, visiting Manhattan. They came for the musicals, that’s their special interest. <newline>  <newline> I’ve been looking at the comment sections and while there are much supportive ones, the lack of support is astounding. “Invisible” illnesses dont exist to the outside world. I’ve seen so much blame on this girl like “Oh why would you even come to NYC if your OCD is that bad?” “Get over it” “so dramatic”  <newline>  <newline> Like it’s such an emotional inconvenience to NT when we experience our own disorders in our own way. It’s like, if we’re not 100% okay (no meltdowns, no symptoms of anything) we cannot experience life. And what they don’t understand we will never be 100%! We have to go about living our life normally as if we dont have this plethora of problems. Yes, we get therapy, we take medication, these things make coping much more easier and healthier for us. But we STILL HAVE THE DISORDERS. No matter how well you’re coping, it can still happen and fall out and manifest into the world.

77;12rr5u8;tips on developing a relationship with a crush?;There’s a guy in my major I have a crush on. We have a few classes together each semester but we’re not really friends, just friendly. He will sit next to me in these classes when his main friend group isn’t around and we’ll chat then. One time he gave me a ride home from school & as a thank you I smoked him out which was probably the first at length conversation we’ve had. Luckily, I think the crush is mutual as outside of our few interactions he will dm me on instagram from time to time (but never anything too forward: like I posted about my birthday and he asked how my party went).  <newline>  <newline> Because of this developing crush, I sometimes avoid eye contact with him or won’t speak to him unless he says something first. (I am the epitome of the ND trait of being eerily quiet until engaged, where my personality will almost slap you in the face haha) So far, he’s been very patient with that but it’s only a matter of time before he assumes I’m not interested and moves on. I just got out of a relationship so I’m not eager to jump into another one, but I am interested in starting a friendship with this guy. It’s just that my nerves around the crush get in the way of me doing so. Have any of you been courageous enough to talk to your crushes? What are some of your go-to talking points when pursuing friendship with others?  <newline>  <newline> Do I be blunt and tell him “I’m not fake or anything i just think you’re really cute so I have no idea how to interact with you without coming off too strong”? And when do I disclose the autism? Especially nervous about that.

82;12q5jd6;How do you actively love yourself?;Hi all, I don’t know who else to turn to (other than my therapist) that has similar experiences to me to just… support me? Words of hope? I’m not sure what I need but I hope it’s alright if I talk here.  <newline>  <newline> My therapist who specializes in autism in women/late diagnosis is writing a letter to my doc to have him refer me to a specialist to diagnose me and since then, it all feels very, very real now. <newline>  <newline> I tentatively self identified around 8 months ago, but I would flip back and forth. To note, my entire friend group, partner, coworkers all agree I have autism as well as my siblings (not my parents because they are in denial but that’s another story). So, the proof is there so to speak and though I am somewhat looking forward to the diagnostic process it has just finally hit me like a ton of bricks.  <newline>  <newline> It’s like I am officially “different”. I also have bipolar disorder type 2, and I thought that was bad enough but it hasn’t affected me as deeply as being autistic (as in the label, obviously being autistic has impacted my life greatly from a young age).  <newline>  <newline> And I know it sounds bad, and this is in no way to be hurtful to others or to autistic people but it feels like a slap in the face. It feels like the world is over because I have been “othered” once again.  <newline>  <newline> I was brave and actually told my new job higher ups about being autistic and they were super supportive and lovely but doing that further cemented the fact that I am. I have never disclosed my mental illness or autism to any workplace.  <newline>  <newline> It makes me feel gross in my skin, my body dysmorphia has been exacerbated by this for some reason which makes no sense. Maybe it’s tied for my desire to be “normal”.  <newline>  <newline> I just want to be like those fit pretty girls on Instagram with big butts. It’s an absolutely ridiculous statement but it’s true. I had a meltdown about it yesterday to my partner and he reassured me that it is just the body dysmorphia talking and that I am beautiful. I wish I could believe him. He says it all the time and I want to believe it and feel it but right now it’s just so hard.  <newline>  <newline> Like out of every possible genetic combination I would have been… I’m this one.  <newline>  <newline> I think I’m gonna go cry about it and lay down.

83;12prhkf;Looking for some guidance;Hello all, i am probably going to type a lot so I apologize in advance. i am obviously not asking for any diagnoses or trying to self-diagnose, but as time goes on I am starting to suspect more and more that I may be on the autistic spectrum. I have been treated for depression and anxiety for almost 6 years now, and have been suspected of and even diagnosed with mood disorders in the past, but it seemed like nothing ever really fit me right. This seemed even more so when my psychiatrists tried to have me start medications for said mood disorders because my body completely rejected most and none seemed to help me at all. This whole idea sort of sparked in a mixture of my boyfriend and i starting to date and TikTok honestly, for one my boyfriend has a sibling who is autistic and eventually ended up asking me if i was. This took me off guard a bit because I hadn’t really ever considered it being a possibility, mostly due to the fact that I have always known to be very empathetic, compassionate, and good at understanding the emotions of others (not that those who are on the spectrum aren’t compassionate of course, from research I have understood that emotions are harder to process)  <newline>  <newline> I took some assessments like RAADS-R, Aspie, Autism Spectrum Quotient, and CAT-Q. All of them resulting the same, signifying that I am autistic. After taking the test it brought my attention to things about myself that prior I really thought nothing of, like sweaters I refused to buy because the material that many would say to be “warm” or “comforting” felt itchy, and made me irritable and angry when I put it on and had to be taken off immediately. Not enjoying certain things like painting although I enjoy art because the feeling of dried paint on my skin made me extremely upset as well. My mother telling me I was “easy” when I was a baby because if I was given a certain toy I would sit in the same place with the one toy for hours straight. Certain “tics” that I thought sprouted from anxiety like hair twirling ( no, not the cutesy kind, like twisting your hair to the point where its starting to damage it) and fidgeting. Not being able to make eye contact, not enjoying being touched or hugged by anyone except for my boyfriend (and not even him sometimes), extreme difficulty managing and keeping friendships and relationships. Not being able to eat or drink certain things because although I might find them tasty if they have any sort of stringy or gritty texture it is an absolute no. My mother actually thought when I was younger I was being difficult because she would try to give me pears or bananas and I’d completely lose it and break down crying trying to eat them.  <newline>  <newline> I was just curious if I’m completely off base here or if some of you relate to some of these experiences. Any enlightenment would be greatly appreciated: I have experienced more apparent symptoms but I wont list them all since this has gotten quite lengthy. I just wanted to end by saying I am new to learning about ASD and what it means to live with it, and by writing this I mean no insensitivity or disrespect, I just want to understand more about it and maybe see if I should be taking further steps for things like treatment, official diagnoses, etc. Any help is appreciated, thank you :);Vintaky;False;0;1.0;2023-04-17 18:17:25;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12prhkf/looking_for_some_guidance/;autisminwomen

85;12nom6k;Self-care vs coping mechanism;So I found a video on tiktok where they talked about the difference between acts of self-care and coping mechanisms. I found it really interesting because a lot of things we (humans in general, that is) do is actually bad even though it might seem joyous in the moment. However, I’m having a hard time to come up with coping mechanisms because apparently it doesn’t work the same for me. So self-care is ”something you do that just brings you joy” and coping mechanisms are ”something you do that brings you joy but also guilt”. Examples (for me): <newline>  <newline> Acts of self-care <newline>  <newline> - Buy a coffee from the local coffee shop when they send out like ”20% off if you order in the app” or ”50% off on your favorite beverage”. It’s like once or twice a month and it’s under $3 each time so even though I’m normally against spending money on something I can do myself, this is something I just do for me because I never actually give myself something that’s a bit ✨extra✨ so this doesn’t give me any kind of guilt. <newline>  <newline> - Potting plants <newline>  <newline> - Play some games (the sims 4 etc) <newline>  <newline> - Learn about astrology <newline>  <newline> - Do something creative <newline>  <newline> - Listen to music <newline>  <newline> And now, here comes the issue for me. I don’t feel guilt when I do things, I feel anxiety. Is that supposed to be the same? And also, the coping mechanisms they state is often something like ”drink alcohol” or ”shopping”. So when I thought about it solely out of an anxiety perspective I get anxious about buying clothes or spend money on things I feel are unnecessary BUT it’s not a coping mechanism since I don’t use shopping clothes as a thing to ignore the actual issue. The anxiety comes from having to do the shopping in the first place, not because I need to like.. ”numb myself” or anything. Same with alcohol, I rarely drink because I don’t like it very much so there’s nothing to get anxious about there either?? The only thing I can think of is that I tend to try and and solve other people’s problems for them. It takes a lot of energy to do so and I’ve figured out the actual ”meaning” behind it. I do it instead of tending to my own, personal problems. So it has to be a coping mechanism, right? Make something for someone else in order to cope with my own crap that I don’t want to deal with and it brings me joy since I really enjoy solving problems. <newline>  <newline> So what would you say your coping mechanisms are? Because I really can’t think of anything else and I need concrete examples in order to understand better.;Offmagician1;False;6;0.81;2023-04-16 00:31:12;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12nom6k/selfcare_vs_coping_mechanism/;autisminwomen

Maybe someone can share their insights on this.) <newline>  <newline> Basically, I am really heavily into: cross-stitching, crocheting, knitting, reading/listening to audiobooks, and diligently sorting/cataloguing my life's worth of fotos and sorting/cataloguing my extensive e-book library. <newline>  <newline> I also really like spending time doing some other things, but not as obsessively, namely binge watching good stuff on Netflix, playing video games, hanging out with some close friends for RPG nights, and hiking with my dogs. <newline>  <newline> I have a partner, 2 teenagers, 2 dogs, and a demanding full time job. <newline>  <newline> Everything that ISN'T any of the things mentioned above feels like a chore to me, and I usually don't wanna do it. I NEED to do any of the things mentioned above every day, otherwise I feel like I go insane. Now, all of these things are clearly very time consuming. I have lists of currently ongoing craft projects, and lists of what I plan to do next. These lists get bigger and bigger, because everytime I see a cool pattern, I add it. It's similar with my books: after I got done cataloguing all of my paperbacks, harcovers, audiobooks and ebooks, it turned out that I currently have a queue of 346 unread books in my posession. <newline>  <newline> I have 5 works in progress for crocheting, 1 one for knitting, 7 for cross stitching. An uncounted amout of patterns in my to-do collection for each of these crafts. (A larger cross-stitch project of the kind that I like typically takes months to years to finish, especially considering my time constraints due to responsibilities.) <newline>  <newline> My photo library? My dad has recently given me hundreds of photos that he had meticulously scanned from paper photographs and photo albums from since when I was born. I myself have hundreds and hundreds of paper photos from my childhood/youth until the time I started to take digital pics (thousands and thousands from then on). I am in the (slow) process of scanning them all with the goal of ending up with a complete record of my whole life in pictures, complete with dates, geotags, and facetags. I am sure that I will end up with a collection of pictures in the 6-figure-area by the end of it. <newline>  <newline> But here's the thing: I will NEVER get any of this ""done"", and I have such a hard time deciding every day what I want to spend my time working on. Oftentimes trying to decide and arguing with myself why one project should take priority over another vs. what I actually FEEL LIKE doing on that day throws me into a paralysis and I end up doing nothing at all - or pointless things, like endlessly scrolling through Facebook reels, instead. And of course I also want to devote time to my ""less obsessive"" things, most of all spend quality time with my partner, like progressing in the video games that we play together. <newline>  <newline> There is never enough time for any of this. Even when I enjoy spending time with one thing, I have this nagging feeling in the back of my head about all the things I am NOT currently doing, and I feel bad about not spending time with my kids and partner. <newline>  <newline> If you know what I am talking about from experience... how do you deal with this? I feel like it's taking a toll on my mental wellbeing sometimes. <newline>  <newline> *TLDR: I have so many time consuming special interests that I don't know which one to devote my limited time to and also still have enough time to give other important things, like spending quality time with my partner and kids doing stuff that they love and it's driving me insane.*";PantaRheia;False;1;1.0;2023-04-15 12:45:47;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12n185y/overwhelmed_with_special_interest_todolist/;autisminwomen

96;12j8y64;Should I have handled this differently?;"I recently moved into a house with new roommates (I had to flee the last place because I was r$%ed by an old roommate). Upon moving into this new place I told the property manager why I was looking at places when she asked, in hindsight I shouldn't have been so vulnerable and honest. I should've just said I was in town for school, it's a college town and I was staying in the area for school. I didn't realize until after moving here how thin the walls are, I'm sure people heard. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I'm moved in and still meeting some of the new roommates and I'm talking to one guy let's call him F. F and I were talking about what we're majoring in and I tell him I'm going into Behavior Analysis. I'm used to many people not really getting what that means so I reference him telling me he wanted to use his key to the schools lab to post a YouTube video of him camping out in there as something we'd probably consider that attention seeking behavior. Full disclosure, I'm autistic and don't realize how some of my words affect others sometimes. The room grew quiet and I realized he might be upset so I quickly try to say things like ""hey we're social animals, we all engage in it! I'm on social media, I'm no exception."" Trying to lighten up the mood. He gets close to me and mutters ""you know what I don't get? Why so many women lie about being r#%ed. It's just so obviously fake"" I was of course immediately uncomfortable but can't decipher on my own if he's taking a jab at me or if he's the house creep or something. I decide to keep my reaction mild to try and assess when I know him better so I just respond well there's plenty of stigma surrounding the crime so maybe it's just looked at differently from other crimes. After living with him for some time I notice he doesn't have similar conversations with anyone else in any sense. As a matter of fact, his talks with our property manager are about him respecting women and all of our rights! He's not just a close talker and he doesn't just talk about crimes at the drop of a hat with anyone. I decide okay it was most likely personal, but he's not worth problems so I'm going to just keep my distance and mind my own business. One day we were doing white elephant in our common area and at the end he says bye to the group, everyone says bye to him and he goes to his room. He walks back out of his room with a small flame thrower unprompted. A surprise to all of my roommates seeing as we were all notified in the lease about not having any open flames because of how old and flammable the house is, breaking the lease could mean being kicked out. He pointed it above the table where everyone was sitting so I asked him ""hey can you not light that above where we're all sitting inside the house?"" I don't think there's anyway that question didn't sound rhetorical, I just definitely didn't see me having to ask this coming. After a roommate from across the table repeats it for him and sited my being high and possibly paranoid a reason. It wasn't, I'm not a fan of a flame thrower going off over my head at any day at any time. He ignored it and lit it off twice. Not being comfortable with talking to him, I let the property manager know. Then I told her why I didn't talk to him directly when she asked. Her take away from it was next time maybe I should apologize sooner when I realize I've said something hurtful and maybe I should talk to him. It took everything in me to spell out for her that she was asking me to seemingly extend an olive branch to a guy who made light of rape and rape victims. I just told her I'm not from an area like this, I'm totally comfortable staying in my lane near neighbors figuring maybe racism may help me avoid talking to F who I knew frankly, if he wasn't a roommate I didn't think I just had to live with, I would've told him to go f*%# his mom. F found a new place to live once other roommates confirmed what the flame thrower being a thing. I do not feel bad that I got him kicked out. Should I have actually been nicer?

97;12j649j;Has motherhood made you more autistic? I have a very normal, social child and I can never get anything done because I have no energy or mind left over for anything extra.;"I am autistic and my 6 year old daughter thankfully is not. She is what society wants a kid to be. She is talkative, charismatic, and thriving socially. She has friends and can participate in all kinds of extracurricular activities. I am so thankful that her experience in life will be vastly different than mine. That being said, being a mother has in a way made me more autistic because my daughter is so social and requires so much of my focus that I am struggling to get things done. <newline>  <newline> I am installing a zip-line that is 250 feet long. We have a Great Pyrenees and want to hook her lead up to the zip-line so she can have 250 feet of yard to run around. It is very hard and at times dangerous project. It involves a lot of legwork and climbing up ladders and climbing up to the treeline. My daughter wants to be with me ALL the time. And she TALKS and does not know how to be quiet. She and my husband are the same in that they could talk for hours without even needing me to participate and they are happy just having me listen. Drives me nuts when I'm working on something. I get overstimulated and frustrated and start making tons of mistakes. Today I melted down and had to go isolate and cried out of frustration. I can't focus on a hard task like this and watch out for my daughter's safety and listen to her talk. I can't tune her out and I can't focus. Today I cut myself 10 times and was bleeding and it was all because I couldn't hyper focus on my work. I've never done this before or used the tools I'm using and I'm using youtube videos to teach myself and having other people around really makes it impossible for me to function.  <newline>  <newline> I really need my daughter to be quiet and independent. I need her to go play and have fun instead of sticking by my side talking and talking. Easier projects I will involve her and get her to help but this project is dangerous and hard and I need her out of the way so I can take care of myself.  This is the 3rd day I've tried to work and I quietly escaped the house and got to work only to have her notice and come out to find me. I've gotten very little done and injured myself a ton undoing mistakes I made. If I could just be alone I could finish fairly quickly.  <newline>  <newline> I love my daughter so much and I don't want my autism to ever hurt her so I hide my stress and don't snap at her and instead ask her nicely to go play or go hang out with daddy but she wants to be with me and will not leave my side. My husband has ADHD and I'll ask him to take her but he'll say ""hey baby you want to go play"" and she'll say ""no"" and he gives up and leaves. He has no attention span. I'll ask for help but he's like a child himself with his unmanaged ADHD and he gets frustrated easy and reacts to stress like a child and snaps at me like I'm inconveniencing him so I just give up and tell him to go away.  <newline>  <newline> But yeah...I know its my tism that I need to be alone to get projects done. Being a mother is so incredibly hard because I rarely get to be alone. I'm years behind on things I want to get done because my brain won't allow me to function. I use to be into cryptocurrency and actually made a yearly income day-trading but I can no longer do that because my daughter is always with me and I can't hyper-focus to study the market. I use to free-lance write articles and I don't have the focus because I'm a mother and can't zone out to write. Being a mother and socially present all the time takes so much energy that I rarely have anything left to do more than normal daily tasks. I love my daughter and love helping her thrive but sometimes it hurts me because I really can't get things done for myself.  Sacrificing myself in ways I will always do because having my focus on her is allowing my daughter to thrive and be happy and she's undamaged and untraumatized and that's so much more important than me finishing projects. My childhood was pure trauma and isolation and  I never want my kid to go through a moment of life alone if she needs me by her side and it helps her thrive.";lifesacellardoor;False;6;0.86;2023-04-12 02:02:27;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12j649j/has_motherhood_made_you_more_autistic_i_have_a/;autisminwomen

I didn't know how to communicate what I was feeling to solve any problems our friendship had (like me feeling overwhelmed, in her shadow, etc), and so I just stopped talking to her the summer before we started college. I hoped it would be a natural ""drifting apart"". understandably, there were unresolved feelings. I'm sure she felt very hurt by my sudden abandonment. <newline>  <newline> we live in the same city and went to school here, too, but didn't see each other again. we spoke once the next year, when I messaged her to ask a quick question about something pertaining to both of us, and she answered casually, and then I attempted to apologize probably in a flimsy way, letting her know I'd had ""things going on with me"" (I thought I had BPD for a little bit) and she said ""lmfao I always knew there was something wrong with you."" it hurt like hell. <newline>  <newline> time passed, and the year after that she followed me on instagram. we didn't talk, just passively liked each other's photos for a couple of weeks. it seemed to be in the past, everything that had happened. then out of nowhere she unfollowed me and I think blocked me, but it was 10 years ago so I can't remember. there were weird things going on with a burner account that was affecting me and I always assumed that was why? or maybe she just didn't want contact. <newline>  <newline> it was all fine, either way. I'd dream with her here and there, in what I assumed to be fits of my brain trying to make sense of how I felt. about five years ago, though, it became more frequent, and I started getting urges to reach out to her. I can't even tell you why exactly: it just sort of happened. I ignored it, thinking about the last thing she'd said to me, even if she was probably still (understandably) angry with me then: it scared me into messaging her every time I thought about it. what I know now was my undiagnosed autistic behavior, is what I'm scared will be what she remembers me by, if she even thinks of me at all. <newline>  <newline> I've talked this through with my therapist, in more detail than here of course, since this post is already long enough lol. but my therapist thinks it's a good idea to reach out to her. I'm not expecting a friendship rekindling out of this. I really don't know how to explain it, but I feel like it's really important that I message her. I feel like something could happen to her (or me, I suppose) and I would regret the way we left things. when I look back now, it seems like a mix of our immaturity and my very shaky understanding of my own feelings, things that make sense for the time and how old we were. we're both turning 30 this year, and my therapist has reminded me that I'm not the same person I was at 17, and she likely isn't either. nothing changes if she doesn't respond either, or responds negatively, since we're already not speaking/a part of each other's lives. <newline>  <newline> it's just... what do I even say? how do you reach out to an old friend? I've done it with other high school friends, but this is a girl that had felt like my long-lost sister, and it feels different.

I don't correct people anymore unless I feel like it is absolutely necessary. **Not for silly grammar or spelling.** That's kid stuff! I'm not on facebook scrolling through the comments just looking for who to correct next... lol. That would be exhausting. <newline>  <newline> But you know, sometimes the urge is crazy. I constantly feel the need to let people know they are using the wrong word, spelling something wrong, doing something incorrectly, etc. But I think it comes from a place of... **I would want to know the correct way to do it. So wouldn't they?** No. Not everyone cares. That blows my mind. Not everyone cares about all the different ways to spell there, their, and they're?? They don't care about the roots and history of the words they use???

So **please** correct me as you will. If my grammar is wrong, I want to know!!! Correct me, good reddit people. I welcome you. <newline>  <newline> ETA2: Wow. Hold your horses. I am just expressing MY discomfort when people are wrong about something. ANYTHING. I don't go around correcting people like a maniac. I don't care what people know. I don't judge. I have discomfort with pranks, jokes, fake things in general because they are LIES. I don't like when people don't know the truth. That is all. I don't actively try to tell them the truth.

102;12h38bl;If you got a formal diagnosis, how long did you have to wait? Are you still waiting? How did you handle it in the meantime?;So, to be clear, I have a formal diagnosis, but I had to wait about 18 months from the time I asked my doctor to send the referral. I found that waiting time to be really difficult because I was going back and forth on whether I should try to find another service that would do it quicker, although I would have to pay for it, doubting whether I was really autistic, doubting whether it was a good idea to get the diagnosis at all, and so on and so forth. In the end I'm really happy I went for it, but the wait sucked. <newline>  <newline> There was also the fact that I did tell a few people that I believed I might be autistic before I got formally diagnosed and there were a lot of people who invalidated me right off the hop. Most of my closest friends did not, but I definitely got a good view into what a lot of people think autism is and, further, how they view autistic people. <newline>  <newline> So, I also wanted to throw that question out to the community here. How long did you have to wait for your formal diagnosis, if you have one? If you're still waiting, how long has it been? How did you/how have you been handling it in the meantime? Were/are you self-diagnosed, did/do you tell people that you think you're autistic, did/do you tell people that you are autistic? I found that period of essentially being in limbo very difficult mentally, personally, because I realistically knew what I was going to be told but at the same time I had a lot of people telling me that I couldn't say that I'm autistic without the formal diagnosis paper, despite the hours of research I had done, the books and articles I read, the introspection I did, etc. I identified a self-diagnosed on Twitter and to a few close friends who accepted that, but I did learn eventually to be very careful with who I told, and what I revealed to those people. Since I got formally diagnosed, I have decided to keep this information close to my chest and not reveal it unless I feel it's necessary, which is very different from what I thought I was going to do when I first began the process. When I first began the process I thought I was going to be much more open about it once I got formally diagnosed but I realized that, piece of paper or not, a lot of people are still going to doubt me because of how I appear outwardly and I don't think it's really worth subjecting myself to that just to try to change their minds. <newline>  <newline> There is a part of me that wants to be open about my diagnosis on social media, especially during autism awareness month, because I think it's important to show that people like me can be autistic too, and to just talk about how difficult masking is and how it almost destroyed me to try to become like everybody else, but I don't know if I'm ready for that yet.;turnontheignition;False;6;1.0;2023-04-10 01:48:36;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12h38bl/if_you_got_a_formal_diagnosis_how_long_did_you/;autisminwomen
103;12h269k;My partner is addicted to TikTok and I don’t know what to do.;I am a 32yo cis man, I have ADHD and anxiety disorder. My partner female/gender-fluid is 25 and on the spectrum. We’ve been together 2.5 years, and although we’ve worked a lot on their past traumas, triggers, etc. it seems like there is no path forward. From the moment they wake up, to when they fall asleep, they spend the majority of their time on instagram reels/YouTube shorts/ tiktok. I’ve counted the time, they average between 3-8 hours a day doom scrolling. They have not been employed for coming up on a year after deciding they weren’t going to go to med school. Since moving in together 1.5 years ago, the division of stuff has been so heavily skewed. They have sensory issues with dishes, so I have washed 99.9% of every dish we’ve dirtied since moving in. I run and fold all of our laundry, vacuum, the vast majority of the cleaning, etc. I work full-time, and have been trying to take a company off the ground solo.  <newline>  <newline> I truly mean it when I say I love this person soo deeply, and I compound feeling awful when I’m getting overwhelmed with life and feel at them.

106;12gebp9;Meltdowns and not wanting to be touched while crying;I think I just had a meltdown. I used to call them panic attacks until I saw someone on TikTok record their meltdown and realized my experience resembled theirs. <newline>  <newline> I started sobbing, rocking back and forth, trying to curl in on myself fighting (and sometimes failing) to keep from hitting my head and arms and chest, and squeeze my head painfully tight between my hands, and while repeating the same three words. Gradually, the urge to hurt myself went away, then the rocking stopped, then the tears slowed, and finally I stopped repeating the same three words. Then I felt drained. <newline>  <newline> I wrote in what I call my “word vomit journal” to try and process some of the thoughts I was having while sobbing. And I’m thinking about listening to some 8d music. <newline>  <newline> I’m curious what you all do after a meltdown? I’d like to add some more tools for myself to try next time. <newline>  <newline> Also, I’ve noticed that the idea of being touched while crying is so upsetting to me that I feel more anxiety when crying around others (anxiety on top of the anxiety I feel already because of someone see me cry) because I’m afraid they are going to try to touch or hug me to comfort me, and saying no would hurt their feelings. <newline> Once, I as crying in front of my mom. She was sitting in a chair on the other side of the room. When she stood up, I wasn’t sure if she was coming to hug me or not and I panicked because I didn’t want to be touched, so my tears stopped almost instantly and I distracted her by asking her to get me something from a different room. Oddly, the idea of having my future romantic partner hold me while I cry seems comforting. But the idea of anyone else touching me while I cry makes me feel panicky. <newline> Anyone else experience this? Anyone else have theories on why the idea of a romantic partner comforting me seems fine, but anyone else feels terrible? <newline>  <newline> TL,DR: I’m curious what you all do after a meltdown?

107;12g3mv4;I just had an epiphany: masking is like acting. Just as actors can experience trauma from playing certain roles, we can also experience trauma from contorting ourselves to fit certain situations.; While watching a video on YouTube by Watchmojo about times when roles traumatized actors, it hit me that this was similar to the Joaquin Phoenix portrayal of the Joker. Being someone you're not for an extended period can have serious effects on your mental state. <newline>  <newline> I had been considering becoming a psychologist for the criminally insane after watching another video. At first, I thought it wouldn't be a problem because nothing really affects me as long as it doesn't involve me directly.

111;12enjq9;Everything finally makes sense but what if they tell me I'm wrong?;"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 18 (this is your warning that I've written you a novel), along with a generalized anxiety disorder (that felt like social anxiety for a few years which I now suspect was just meltdowns) and depression. My mother is a psychologist and I was privileged enough to have a direct pathway to an assessment because of her connections. However, at the time, the adult screening checklist didn't exist and I wasn't technically a child anymore, so most professionals weren't screening anyone my age. I was able to receive that diagnosis solely because my mother was able to convince someone in her industry to take a look at me. At the end, they said ""yeah, you PROBABLY have it"" and I was sent on my way with a prescription.  <newline>  <newline> Here's the problem, though: Why did I care that I couldn't stop shaking my leg when my apparent depression was debilitating me to the point of suicidal ideation? Not for the first time, might I add. So I forgot about it for 14 years.  <newline>  <newline> I started a new job at the end of 2021 and one of my new coworkers told me they were on the spectrum within a few times of speaking. I knew I had ADHD and that was kind of in the same wavelength, but I hadn't given it any thought since I was a kid and I stopped taking medication within a month of my diagnosis. I couldn't stop thinking about them though. I was fascinated first by the fact I had never known someone on the spectrum to look and sound and act the way they did. Then that made me wonder if what I thought of people with ADHD was also skewed. If that was the case, then there was something about me fundamentally that I was misunderstanding. Which is... one of my biggest fears.  <newline>  <newline> I had to break down those ideas and understand them. I was given new information to suggest what I believed to be correct was no longer correct, and I must be accurate. So I went to TikTok and my entire world blew the fuck up in the best way possible. I finally understood so many things about myself.  <newline>  <newline> I told my doctor and I started taking my meds again a couple of months ago. My life doesn't necessarily feel easier but beginning to understand myself and have ways to ""deal"" with my symptoms has made a powerful impact.  <newline>  <newline> It is draining to be consuming and processing so much all of the time, so I don't let myself go to TikTok and scroll unless I am ready to hyper-fixate and cry, and because I forget it exists because it's on the last screen of my home screen which I never swipe to usually. 🤣  <newline>  <newline> The last few days however, my FYP began to give me a lot of content about AuDHD and autism. As soon as one video felt relatable, I'd scroll to another and so would it. I did this for eight hours straight for three nights in a row, having epiphany after epiphany after epiphany. So many things in my life and in my brain are starting to make sense. I am crying all of the time because I feel so happy. I feel so relieved. I finally, finally understand. All I ever wanted was to understand, because then I can make it work.  <newline>  <newline> I've already made appointments with my doctor and I'll see my therapist next week as well. I've researched how to get a diagnosis and the cost and how long I'll be waiting, etc. I have written novels on the notes app about how to explain to these people why I am absolutely convinced I have autism too, including statistics and every detail I can think of to explain, finally, WHY.  <newline>  <newline> Yet I am still shaking as I write this to all of you because I do not want to take up space, and I do not want to finally make sense only to be told no, it isn't that, it's something else. Or even worse, it isn't that and we can't tell you what it is. Here's some pills, go forget about it until you're dead.  <newline>  <newline> Is this a safe place?

116;12bx5wr;Should I seek a second opinion ?;"For context I'm french (F35) so sorry my english is weird, and living in France, so diagnosis process may be different.   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> For years I have been wondering if I was autistic but I never dared to go see a psychologist, partly because I was afraid that I was mistaken, but mostly because I just dread having to make a phone call to make an appointment and the idea of talking about private stuff to someone I don't know.   <newline> Last year I found videos on Youtube of people talking about their life having both ASD and ADHD, and I was really feeling like they were talking about me. I also checked other videos of people with only ADHD, and I was relating but not as much. <newline>  <newline> So 2 month ago I found the courage to make a appointment with a psychologist specializing in ASD and ADHD. The first appointment went well, she said that it was likely that I had both ASD and ADHD so we decided on a date for the diagnosis and she gave me several evaluation forms to fill at home before the diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> The day of the diagnosis, I tooked several tests but she did not read the forms I filled at home. The tests I took were WAIS-IV, a test where I had to look a faces or only the eyes and choose the correct emotion in a list, and a test where I had to answer questions like ""Why do humankind should explore space?"", ""Why do we recycle plastic?"", ... <newline>  <newline> When I saw her for the result of the diagnosis, she said that the tests I took are the main source of her diagnosis, not the forms she had me fill at home. She told me I have ADHD and dyscalculia, and that since I scored really high on the IQ test, I am High Potential, and that it is the reason why my ADHD was not detected earlier. <newline>  <newline> But then she told me it was unlikely that I have ASD because I had a good score on the faces test and I only had trouble identifying the emotions when the expressions were subtles.    <newline> (I did struggle with the part with only the eyes, I thought none of the emotions corresponded but went with the one that I though was the least far or the most neutral, and apparently guessed right most of the time)   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> She thinks all my social difficulties are due to the ADHD. So I was a bit taken aback and not completely convinced. After that she told me that this just her own diagnosis, and that only a psychiatrist can make an official diagnosis (would have been nice to know before the diagnosis, I would have gone directly to psychiatrist). Also all the appointments were online, she never saw me face to face even though in the first appointment she said she would need to see me at her office at least once. And during the last appointment she talked a lot about how she also has ADHD, and she did provide some useful advice on it but now I'm afraid that maybe she was too focused on it because she has it. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> TLDR: Psychologist say I have ADHD, dyscalculia and High Potential, but cannot have ASD because I did not fail the faces test. <newline>  <newline> So I have some questions: <newline>  <newline> \- for the people who have an ASD diagnosis : did you all failed the faces/eyes test ?    <newline> \- should I seek a second opinion ?   <newline> \- if the High Potential can ""hide"" my ADHD, can it not also ""hide"" the ASD ?";Crimson_pandora;False;4;0.79;2023-04-04 21:25:47;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12bx5wr/should_i_seek_a_second_opinion/;autisminwomen

118;12bpd1f;Has anyone had success using online apps/websites to make friends in person?;Making friends can be really hard for me, especially as I get older. One of my closest friends essentially “broke up” with me (I’ve included more details in the edit at the bottom for anyone who is interested) and I honestly feel very alone right now.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve heard that there are apps kinda like online dating apps, but for making friends. Apparently even Bumble has a setting just for making friends. <newline>  <newline> Has anyone tried something like this and, if so, have you actually been able to create a friendship this way? If not, do you have other suggestions on how to make friends (besides the usual advice a lot of NTs tend to give….I posted this question on this subreddit for a reason lol)? <newline>  <newline> EDIT: <newline>  <newline> I’m going through a really rough time in my life due to my dad going through health issues and spending time with friends is one of the only things that helps. I recently noticed that one of my friends unfollowed me on Twitter (which was weird because we are both very active on Twitter). I texted her about it to apologise if I had done anything wrong to upset her. I also told her how much she meant to me as a friend. She replied saying we aren’t close enough to “garner this sort of reaction” (I guess implying that I had no right to be upset). She then went on to say that we’ve “clearly”grown as people and that means we’ve grown apart. I’ve been away for school for the past 3 years but am home now due to my dad’s illness. I kept up with her while I was away and made plans to see her as soon as I got home. But she had excuse after excuse (I’m not saying they weren’t really, but she never made an effort to say, “how about this day instead?”). I’m absolutely gutted by this because all my other friends in my hometown are her friends too, therefore I feel I’ve lost pretty much all my friends and I’m having to start from scratch.;Orchid-Owl;False;5;0.86;2023-04-04 17:02:55;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12bpd1f/has_anyone_had_success_using_online_appswebsites/;autisminwomen

120;12b9aji;Trying to explain to friend how autism diagnosis affects me but I'm seemingly damaging friendship?;Hello! First time posting here.  <newline>  <newline> My whole life my worst struggle has been making and maintaining friendships: both in person and online. During lockdown was lucky enough to feel more included into a friendship group which included people who lived semi-close to me and then their mutual friends who lived up and down the country. We mainly interacted via Discord/gaming. Unfortunately, in late 2021 my grandma passed away extremely suddenly from health complications and I was in a job where I was already struggling to get adjustments from my manager in my other disability (I'm deaf and wear hearing aids). Around the same time, the girls in this friendship group who I thought I had built an almost 'best' friendship with began to feel quite distant and at the time when I tried to verbalise this and ask for some adjustments (back then I didn't realise they could quite literally be adjustments to help me deal with confusing text social cues I believe I had worded it more like 'could I have this favour to help me get over some anxiety') it unfortunately snowballed into a big argument in which my anxiety and frustration over confusing social cues (i.e being unsure that general 'at' everyone invites in the discord meant I could comfortably join in and so on) but at the end of it all, I apologised for my shortcomings and said that I would try and work on my confidence. <newline>  <newline> The year passed on and I did more research into autism and my own childhood and a lot of things began to make sense. I'm someone with a very heightened sense of justice so I get easily frustrated. The entirety of life to me has unspoken rules and dynamics and often I find myself tripping myself up in social situations as I follow these rules I've convinced myself are there since childhood (e.g 'it's rude to invite yourself places, if you're not explicitly asked, you're not invited'). I am incredibly overwhelmed by, and dislike, group chats and find them draining (apparently the social dynamic is that it's entirely casual and nobody should ever expect replies... so what is the point of them?). Obviously then a lot of other behaviour traits too. <newline>  <newline> The past three months I've noticed this friendship group occasionally hang out in person and despite me only being an hour away, I never get explicitly invited. From the last argument, I try to stop my anxiety in it's tracks by recognising 'oh they probably just assume I'm too far away!' 'maybe they assumed I wouldn't want to do that!' so I started approaching them and being direct that I hope they remember I'm always happy to visit. That it hurts to not be thought of etc. <newline>  <newline> Finally yesterday one of the friends asked me if all my questioning actually reassures me in any way. I explained now it's never really reassurance, I've just learnt with my autism that my brain is almost like training an AI model. I like finding out all the facts so it doesn't spit out anxiety and because I truly believe deep down they're not purposefully leaving me out. I also like knowing what happened when I missed out on an opportunity, in case I can rectify it next time. She replied that despite what I'm saying, it doesn't sound true and that it's not fair for people to keep defending when they do things without me. She asked if I would like to come back to the group chat to see that 'it's nothing against you'. I stated that I agree, I really don't want people to feel they have to defend their decisions to me, I just like to feel involved in knowing what's going on to see if I can make myself more available for the next opportunities. I explained that group chats were overwhelming and that I left theirs as it only put me at risk of anxiety or meltdowns from getting confused at text tone etc. I also apologised again that my actions came across as passive aggressive as the intention was never there. I tried to explain that my autism makes me do things that will happen repeatedly as it's the way my brain works and that I'm learning to unmask. But that I'll try and do better. <newline>  <newline> She finally replied that 'if I don't want to be in the group chat despite her explaining that group chats aren't a big thing what can be done here', she went onto say (and I honestly think she's completely valid) that her and others have tried to explain social cues in the past and it feels like I'm not listening. And that 'this' keeps happening. That it doesn't matter what my intentions were, as I am passive aggressive. She also stated that my apologies don't really fit anymore as I don't seem to be changing and that I'm dragging her and others feelings into collateral damage with the way I act. She then ended her message again saying it feels like I've not changed or attempted to change. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> So I guess all I'm asking is have I really f'ed myself here by unmasking way too quickly/asking way too blunt questions about outings I'm not involved in? I think she's completely valid for not wanting to defend when her and the others don't invite me to things but I've never really been told either that I'm allowed to feel upset when I am excluded (not on purpose). It hurts because in the year after the first argument, I coped with a lot of major life changes and trying to get my autism diagnosis sped up on my own and have been trying to be better. But if I haven't changed, I'm wondering what's the best way to say I'm genuinely sorry and will leave them alone (but whilst also managing my own mental health)?;howl-crossing;False;2;1.0;2023-04-04 04:48:50;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12b9aji/trying_to_explain_to_friend_how_autism_diagnosis/;autisminwomen
121;12axllt;On busy days, what’s something one could do to rebalance and rest in the short breaks in between?;I find myself just going to TikTok in the gaps within busy days, but seeing as I’m still processing information it doesn’t feel like an effective way to prevent a burnout.  <newline>  <newline> We’re talking about short gaps of time, like 10 to 30 minutes that don’t require leaving the location you’re already in. So if you’re cooking dinner and waiting for the oven to ping etc.  <newline>  <newline> Also, options for in public and in private would be great too! <newline>  <newline> As an example of what I mean, I quite like to just sit in a window and listen to birds (but when I’m living in the city there isn’t very nice ambient noise outside so I don’t have that option lol);sagecat_eliza;False;1;1.0;2023-04-03 20:57:58;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12axllt/on_busy_days_whats_something_one_could_do_to/;autisminwomen
122;12ajfww;The importer syndrome is real;I (26/f) don’t even know how to start, since I genuinely have no idea where the problem lies… however, I suppose I can start with the palpable and tangible conundrum.  <newline>  <newline> I’m in the process of writing my master’s thesis, and in the section I’m currently working on requires me to transcribe 8hrs worth of interviews (that I had to conduct one-on-one). Now I can’t start working on anything relating to the thesis without disassociating.  <newline>  <newline> I am most likely AuADHD (although, apparently I am too good at conversations and want friends so I can’t possibly be autistic, and apparently too smart to have ADHD, according to the lady that did my assessments: hence the uncertainty) cause everything that I have read are the side effects of these forms of neurodivergence -  in *society*, do not feel inclined to blame the neurology for its lack of accommodation - are issues that I have had for as long as I can remember. <newline>  <newline> I see people mention autistic burnout quite frequently online, both here and on Twitter, but I never understood what that implies. In a way, the only way, I know how, to explain how I’ve been feeling since March 2021, is **burnout**, but whenever I say that people do not seem to believe me. My mother is on sick leave from work due to persistent burnout, and I know that what she has described is almost identical to how I feel. <newline>  <newline> But I’m also worried that it might just be me being undisciplined, and lacking proper routines. I know for a fact the latter is true, but for some reason I just can’t seem to build a proper one where I can work on the thesis consistently. Literally, I can barely even get myself to do the things I enjoy. And, as I mentioned earlier my diagnosis is potentially allistic, so I don’t even know if it is right to write this here. I just enjoy the community, and I feel like you guys are the only ones that might take me seriously. <newline>  <newline> What is autistic burnout, and if I recognize myself in what you describe, what are the best steps to deal with it? I have no professional help to get, besides the university psychologist, but that is mostly talk-therapy, and I don’t really see it helping besides keeping my head above water (so to speak). <newline>  <newline> Sorry if I should have written this somewhere else, I’m just at my wits end.;uneasyphilosopher;False;1;0.72;2023-04-03 12:49:36;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12ajfww/the_importer_syndrome_is_real/;autisminwomen

124;129hjcv;Is anyone else like this?;I’ve noticed something about myself (adult female)  <newline>  <newline> Even when I’m nonverbal I still share links and such but then I may not reply to peoples messages and responses to what I send. But then if I don’t I feel bad that they may think I’m ignoring them so I’ll force myself to respond because society has taught me so. Honestly alot of the time talking drains me….drains me so fucking much man…now that I’m really thinking about it. That’s why I love parallel play so much….I like being quiet with others (minus certain people and certain times) but I feel if I’m quiet that then…people will find me boring and rude so I fucking force myself to speak. That’s why I love being alone in my room cause I don’t have to speak I make noises and sing to myself like vocal stims (certain chorus lines over and over) but other than that I’m quiet and content. I remember back when I hung out with friends a lot. I’d normally get “sick” after and need a few day rest period , my mom would call it out a lot how I’d be sick and tired after hanging with friends.  I realize now it’s because all my energy and such was completely drained out of my body. So I’d need a few days of legit sleep and rest and quiet to recoup. I also create stuff for tiktok however can’t seem to make videos of me talking like I have a few times but I much prefer lip singing and showing emotions through my facial features and movements. I also don’t go live because it’s so draining to even muster up the energy to speak and I can’t properly start conversations. I feel like at this point I’m just talking 80% of the time because I feel forced to due to society.;LopsidedCompote5187;False;8;0.93;2023-04-02 10:45:01;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/129hjcv/is_anyone_else_like_this/;autisminwomen
125;129fl66;How to deal with burnout?;"So, I've been looking into myself and researching since I got diagnosed, and I genuinely believe I might be in a hardcore burnout. I remember I was most likely burnt out from 2015 - 2019 because of abusive parents, my environment, etc. Once I moved into an apartment with my husband and roommate in 2019, I let myself rest for months and really started to feel better. I felt the weight of the world was starting to lift off of me.   <newline> Then, of course, COVID hit in 2020. We got (illegally) evicted from our apartment in June of 2020 and we had to move in with the in-laws. That got me burnt out again. I basically LIVED in my room for 2 years, until we moved out of state in early 2022.    <newline> Now, with us being in a semi-stable place and I'm able to try and relax and live again, I can't seem to pull myself out of this feeling. I don't feel like I did. I've stopped drawing (my hobby/life/career pursuit), I've stopped listening to music, I've stopped basically everything except playing video games on my laptop. I can't even sleep most nights because I'm just mindlessly scrolling TikTok or thinking too much - this is on top of taking 75 mg of Hydroxyzine and 20 mg of Fluoxetine. I don't feel ""depressed"" - my doctor even put me on multiple antidepressants last year and they didn't work.   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Are there any ways I could try and pull myself out of this?

126;129a398;Struggling a little with my autism and the future, any advice or anything?;I’m 20F and I dropped out of college because I also have ADHD and couldn’t keep up with it right now. I kind of feel so along even in the autistic community (I’m self diagnosed btw and don’t want an official diagnosis) because I never masked growing up. I see a lot of tiktoks where people are saying that they felt like something was wrong with them and that they were different from everybody else but I always kind of felt the opposite. I felt like I was the normal one and everybody else was weird. Did anyone else feel this way growing up? I feel like it’s truly only me that felt this way.  <newline>  <newline> I also now have to learn how to appear normal, and I’ve learned a lot about social cues because I did go to college for a little bit before dropping out and could analyze how people interacted with one another. But now I have to learn how to mask for the workforce. I don’t want to be misunderstood any more than I already am. And so now I have to learn how to mask and just kind of hope I don’t burn out while also knowing that a majority of autistic people don’t have jobs. I can reassure myself by knowing that a lot of us are probably undiagnosed, but still. It’s just, I have such a difficult road ahead of me and I can’t do anything to help it. I feel so helpless and I don’t like this feeling because I like being in control of things.  <newline>  <newline> If anyone has any advice or stories or anything, that would be nice.

133;12748j8;Real discussion: do you believe autistic/neurodivergent identity politics helps or hurts your life as an autistic woman?;"Since Autism Awareness Month is coming up I thought I'd ask this question. Politically, I'm on the far-left and I've seen an explosion of autism-related liberal identity politics in the past few years, primarily on places like TikTok and IG (not to mention everyone adding ""neurodivergent"" to their Twitter bios). <newline>  <newline> Personally, I have mixed feelings on turning autistic into a political identity. I'm in my 30s and remember how much of a clusterfuck liberal identity politics were last decade, and I hate to see anything related to autism going down that route. It results in autistic people acquiring siege mentalities, thinking they're ""transgressive"" or ""revolutionary"" just because they're autistic, thinking other autistic people who *want* to improve our communication/coping skills are ""sellouts"", demanding that NTs cater to them 24/7, etc.  <newline>  <newline> At the same time, I still think some degree of political/social advocacy is necessary in that it de-stigmatizes us and enables us to be open about the challenges we face as autistic people without NTs infantilizing us or thinking we're incapable of being mature adults. <newline>  <newline> What do others on here think?";falafelville;False;15;0.87;2023-03-31 00:19:30;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/12748j8/real_discussion_do_you_believe/;autisminwomen

Specifically the cadence of certain voices suck my mind in like a vacuum and make me incapable of rest and put me at risk of getting ""stuck"" in what I can only describe as a sort of sleep paralysis in the sounds. It's a torturous experience and the only way I can circumnavigate this trigger is with very good noise canceling headphones but when it does arise unexpectedly it's so awful. I can't put to words the experience... it's like the infrastructure of my brain wraps around what it can't quite make out and hyper focuses on the stimulus involuntarily. Such an occurrence can entail a lot of crying and softly begging please stop turn it off. I'm still sort of lucid and understand how ridiculous I look but... trapped in my head.

135;126vg1w;Tl:dr what sounds can you feel in your body?;Sry for the long post. I decided to tell a bit about my diagnostic journey as well as a description of the sounds that I feel (last paragraph) <newline>  <newline> I am currently investigating if I could be autistic. I have had a lot of moments of 'holy shit - there are other people out there, that thinks and acts like me!!!' and ugly-crying to some of the videos on youtube with autistic folks telling about their (my) experiences through life.  <newline>  <newline> Been reading the diagnostic criteas in DSM and ICD (since I live in Europe) and some sound familiar, yet still some just don't. So. I dunno. <newline>  <newline> Investigating this is really exiting though, Im reading a lot both english and danish resources and have watched hours of videos. Its mind-blowing to read and hear other people talk about something, that I though I was all alone in the world with. Its fucking amazing... But also exhausting, bc I do not know anyone who could reasonable confirm or dismiss my speculations.  <newline>  <newline> Some things just fit, especially when I listen to high-masking late diagnosed women. I dont need someone to confirm this - its just exacly how my life has been and is. No doubt. Eye contact, scripting conversation, analyzing body language, copying others, using 'social tactics' just trying to get through a simple conversation, its exhausting... Other people seem to just do it (and they do, I asked my husband and friends) but I can't and spend tons of energy trying to get it right. <newline>  <newline> Some things, though, I cannot recognize. Like stimming? Well I bite my lower lib a lot, but it could just be a bad habit. I have Restless legs, so yes, they act out a bit, but its not a selftsoothing behavior, as I experience it. And there is a lot of other behaviors and experiences, that does not seem instantly familiar.  <newline>  <newline> So... Now it is getting real meta. I have been observing myself, my thoughts and behaviors, these last couple of weeks and one thing, that I am experiencing, but had totally ignored for years is that I do feel sounds that others around me do not.  <newline> I know its quite normal for everyone, NT and ND alike, to feel goosebums when hearing something rly beautiful or when they get scared or an uncomfortable feeling when tirebreaks squeal. <newline>  <newline> I have noticed that I actually feel a lot of sounds on my upper arm all the time. Its usually real subtle, tingling sensation. Except for fast running water.  eg when it is running out of a faucet and if it runs really fast it gets unfomfortable. If my husband is listening to music and doing the dishes at the same time I can't be in the kitchen bc the feeling overwhelms me. I feel stressed out. Almost fight or flight. It has always been like this and I dont know how to expain it, but maybe it could be sensory processing issues or what do you think?  <newline>  <newline> Is there a sound that you can feel? If so, what sound and where on your body? How does it feel for you?  <newline>  <newline> Ty for reading and for any comments you might share <3;Content_Equipment701;False;4;0.86;2023-03-30 18:36:19;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/126vg1w/tldr_what_sounds_can_you_feel_in_your_body/;autisminwomen

Some people told me that I'm annoying and in life I won't find people as tolerant of me as they are.

137;1260vo3;How to get a boyfriend?;23F autistic and ADHD.  <newline>  <newline> I always struggled with keeping up hygiene and a nice style. I have curly hair and it's hard to maintain for me. <newline> I never really had guys interested in me or approaching me, I do the first approaching always and I get rejected. A few times for being socially awkward and many others for my looks. Specifically they have said that my hair is frizzy, too short (shoulder length), that I'm too thin/no curves.. <newline>  <newline> I have been lately trying to keep up with my looks, it makes me kind of sad that they count so much. Plus I don't have good social skills to make up. Since I can't get close to a guy easily by being friends with him, I feel like I have to count on being approached based on looks more. I saw another neurodivergent woman saying the same and I relate.  Also I see many married lovely women on here, so any advice would be precious. <newline>  <newline> Whenever I meet new people they ask me if I have a boyfriend and one time among a group of 7 girl acquaintances I was the only single one. And it was awkward cause they'd bring their boyfriends and they had moments where they'd kiss and cuddle and I just stared at the wall. They were of many shapes and sizes, they had loving boyfriends, I don't get why I get so much rejected over my looks when I see that many types of women can land nice guys. It could be that I'm meeting guys from dating apps and they usually meet theirs from Facebook or common friends.

139;125wnqf;I wanted to get engaged and now I don't really want to get married;"So back in 2019, my partner and I had planned a trip to go to Disney World. We had been together for 2 years at that point and already knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We had talked about buying each other rings to symbolize our love and did our exchange near the castle. So this was an engagement of sorts though we had no intention of getting married any time soon. After the trip, of course everyone at work is goo goo ga ga over my ring and our Disney trip photos. The thing was though, my family didn't care at all and neither did his family. Actually, since 2019, the topic of marriage is NEVER brought up by either family. I knew that neither family would likely care at all as we both come from difficult family situations. Well, I tried to think about a wedding and what that would look like. I thought about who I would even have to invite considering I have no friends except for people I talk to at work who I am most definitely not close enough with to ask to be a bridesmaid or anything. I also have no extended family that I talk to. So I'd have no friends, no family, and just my mom and sister who do not care at all if I get married. They don't dislike my partner. My sister hangs out with us a lot and my mom is cold towards basically everyone so it's not him. My mom went through a very nasty divorce while I was a teenager and it changed our entire family dynamic. So on top of having no family and no friends to invite, I also watched my parents go through a pretty rough breakup that lasted five years for everything to be finalized. So I do have this idea in my head that nothing is forever and I would want a prenup. My partner is 100% okay with this prenup which is great. He completely understands why I want it and now thinks that everyone should get one too. So then there is the topic of weddings being stupid expensive and who am I even trying to impress? My coworkers that most definitely wouldn't even come if they were invited? My distant family that like my photos on Facebook but haven't said a word to me in literal years? So I have no family, no friends, damaged feelings towards the idea of marriage, will need to pay for a lawyer for the prenup, and you can't convince me to even spend $1000 on a wedding. Now we could definitely just go to the courthouse and sign the papers, just the two of us and no one around. We honestly could get away without even telling anyone since we both already wear rings on our ring fingers. So my last gripe is that I think I would feel SUPER awkward calling my partner ""my husband"". Like the thought of having to saying ""my husband"" in front of my mom makes me cringe and I don't know why. I am almost 30 years old and yet I almost always still feel like I am a teenager. I see people my age having children and getting married and I still have that thought of ""ooh how taboo"" even though it is perfectly reasonable to be doing these things at this age. In fact, when my mom was my age, she already had two children at home and I was going into kindergarten. I think I just don't feel mature enough. Sometimes I wish we just hadn't bought each other the rings. I love that we have them but sometimes it just feels like so much pressure to be this neurotypical person that I know I can't be. It was my idea too. I really do think it had a lot to do with me wanting to relate to the other women I work with.  <newline>  <newline> So long story short, I don't feel mature enough to be the 29 year old person I have to be.";cinematicloneliness;False;8;0.82;2023-03-29 18:34:00;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/125wnqf/i_wanted_to_get_engaged_and_now_i_dont_really/;autisminwomen
140;125i9g4;Boredom intolerant;Hey everyone! So, I’ve not been officially diagnosed yet, but have been doing a lot of research and talking to people on Facebook and now here. I highly suspect I am PDA autistic and ADHD. Through this discovery I’ve realized how disconnected from my body I’ve been in order to hide all of my sensory issues. A new thing I’m experiencing, and I’m wondering if it’s related to autism, is that I am intolerant to boredom. When I start feeling bored I start feeling anxious. Like borderline panic attack anxious unless I’m able to distract myself somehow. It’s weird because sometimes I can get lost in my thoughts and zone out for a while without feeling bored, but other times (like when I’m stuck in a boring college class or am having to drive), I get boredom anxiety. Is this a thing anyone else experiences? Could it be related to autism or maybe it’s ADHD?;Hi-ImProbablyAnxious;False;1;0.71;2023-03-29 09:18:53;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/125i9g4/boredom_intolerant/;autisminwomen
141;125e94g;I feel like a bad friend;I am very blessed and have many caring friends. Most of which suffer with borderline personality disorder which I also have. They love to socialize often and send 15+ minutes of Snapchat videos daily. I simply cannot handle that level of socialization. I love them, and what they have to say matters to me. But I find myself crying and approaching a meltdown when I force myself to watch videos of them talking and sending videos back. I can really only sustain 1 social day a week with friends ( which is always Thursday). So when I’m trying to charge my battery for that day and interacting over the phone depletes it daily, I lose functioning. Today I had to ask my ( long distance military) fiancé for help creating a plan to take care of daily tasks like bathing and eating. I love my friends, and because they have bpd they can feel very invalidated and hurt if I’m not answering them. I understand this so much because I can be like that as well. But on that same note. Bpd and autism are so difficult as a combination. I have to charge my social battery to avoid a meltdown and/ or an episode. I wish I didn’t feel like such an alien. I feel broken since I can’t socialize as much as I wish I could. My whole life I’ve been this way and I feel broken. Growing up I wanted friends so bad. And now I have them, but I just can’t socialize as much as is expected by society. My best friend in the world is also diagnosed with autism and she and I have the best relationship and we only ever charge each other’s social battery. I wish my other friends understood. They’re lovely and supportive, but I’m scared of hurting them just by being myself and telling them that I need so much alone time to survive.

Also a blessing and a curse.  <newline> I am currently working in the healthcare industry as an instructional designer. I don't have any formal education or training because i never went to college. My specific triggers are highly connected to things you encounter in that type of environnement (deadlines, social things, politics, and subjects connected to my dyscalculia learning disorder. This so sad but i literally didn't go to college because i can't do math). I'm your typical ""twice exceptional"" with a genius level IQ who can't meet their potential due to meltdowns from triggers and easy exhaustion. Being in the corporate world i can totally see how college would have better prepared me for this.  <newline>  <newline> instead of college went to a couple different trade schools in my life. And none of them are related to my current trade.  <newline>  <newline> I don't want the job i currently have because of culture, leadership and communication problems. The office politics are so freaking overwhelming for me and no one takes accountability they just blame other people. I'm exhausted and drained and it's not a safe space for ND people. I have tried so hard to make changes for us, but it's been fruitless. <newline> i was supposed to get on the job training and my thought was i would move on to a new challenge once i felt capable, but that hasn't happened at all and I've been here for almost 2 years and still don't have any real practical experience with instructional design. So i don't really know what to do.  <newline>  <newline> Notable is my partner works for the same company, a director in a different department, and they give me a ton of advice for talking to my coworkers and i don't know if I'm capable of being a good employee without their help. Because I'm so good at masking I'm scared about getting hired for something and then being like WHOOPS.  <newline>  <newline> I want to get more education but I'm just simply not going to enroll in college due to time, money and triggers. I would if my skills were able to be done online in a self paced environment but only certain limited subjects are eligible for that. I love learning but the higher education system is not compatible with me.  <newline>  <newline> So my options are non-accredited certificate courses. There's endless options out there.  <newline>  <newline> At this point, in the post, consider revisiting my questions list at the beginning.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> PS my niche expertise is naturalism, horticulture and sustainability (if anyone knows of anything remote in this field lol). I used to run my own successful business but overworked myself and had a massive burnout breakdown which is why i pivoted to ID.

I literally just want more money, I don't care about your damn company, working with you and/or hearing from you as long as the company don't go belly up or lay me off for whatever reason.

I don't know how to pick up the pieces and gain confidence as an ND person when I do still struggle with basic things other do not. I'd like to try occupational therapy but I just haven't found one suitable for my needs - it is very hard and my own ""strategies"" coupled with the meds are just not helping me.  <newline>  <newline> Of course, the neuroticism of ASD doesn't help matters either but I feel like I'm just stuck in the mindset I've been in for years before even realizing I'm ND to begin with, and absolutely nothing can get me out.

What have you learned from it? How did you apply the findings to discovering how to EXACTLY help yourself?

147;122v5ew;I screwed up socially but am still not sure what I did wrong;My Grandad came over for a family dinner this evening and this man loves Facebook and has been making increasingly more offensive statements, (tw for homophobia) saying the LGBTQ+ community are modern colonisers, and how LGBTQ pride is bad because pride is one of the seven deadly sins. <newline>  <newline> I wasn’t going to mention any of it, I was just going to get through the dinner, until my mom said “what’s the crazy things you’ve been writing online”, he said they were just meant as a joke, I said even if something is meant as a joke or not it can still be offensive. <newline>  <newline> I wasn’t told until everyone left that what I said was really poorly worded to say to someone in their 70s and rude.

152;1203okr;Creating scaffolding by following along... ?;I just started moon planning (planning based on moon cycles instead of the regular calendar). And I was really struggling with it. It was hard for me to follow the process, to sit down and plan. <newline>  <newline> There's a channel on youtube where someone has started posting videos on the the full moon. I guess they do weekly prompts and bimontly videos on the full and new moon. I found the weekly prompts too much, but I liked the full moon video. I guess being able to follow along on new and full moons would be enough for me.  <newline>  <newline> I do tarot readings on both new and full moon, along with inner assessments on where I am. In addition to planning out the next week. On new moons I try to set goals for them month. On full moons I am trying to make sure I've done the bulk of the work for the cycle (kinda like a two week sprint), and the next two weeks are wrapping it up. <newline>  <newline> In the past I watched a lot of planner videos, just scanned them for ideas, it didn't feel right to try to plan with them as the video suggested. But for some reason with this full moon video I found myself following along, pausing when I needed to. They talked a a bit bout the moon, and read a tarot spread, so did I. <newline>  <newline> I don't know if they'll continue doing it, but I found it very helpful. <newline>  <newline> I don't know if there are other things like this, I've tried workbooks, but I've realized I don't have the ability to structure on my own, if that makes sense? It seems I need to be able to trail someone else and not do it live, because I need to pause and process at my own pace. I could literally walk away for an hour or a day and come back to it. I can also rewind and skip ahead, or go back over part of a video again later. Something about hearing them process it helps me process it in a way I can't seem to do on my own... It's different than a class because in a class the teacher seems to talk *at* me, not do *with* me. And classes seem want you to do it their way, not figure out your own way. Not sure if that makes sense.  <newline>  <newline> I did experiment again with this video idea to see if it would work with something else. Decided to buy a workbook recently because someone did a video series on it. They did an exercise a week, following the workbook. I was hoping this would provide me with scaffolding to actually do the workbook. Turns out that it didn't work out well for me this time.  <newline>  <newline> Something about the workbook doesn't work for me. It's a pretty book, but hard for me to understand, and also I've learned some of this stuff already, what they're teaching goes against the grain. It doesn't go in depth like I expected, the exercises break things I can do at once into steps that are disruptive to my flow and way of thinking. I'm not really sure what to do with it. Was hoping for a weekly thing to do to help me figure stuff out since I don't have a therapist or anything to help with processing shit and moving forward in life.  <newline>  <newline> I'm not sure why that one video worked so well for me, and I'm struggling with everything else. I can't put my finger on what is working and what isn't. I don't even know what to ask about it, other than trying to narrow down what is actually working for me, and how to find it or make it happen consistently.;--2021--;False;0;0.5;2023-03-24 00:48:49;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1203okr/creating_scaffolding_by_following_along/;autisminwomen

It actually hurts me* physically that I can’t make this list in perfectly organized rainbow order. I almost crashed my car looking for a rainbow in the sky after a storm yesterday. Ha. 2) Thunderstorms. Specifically tornadoes. You’re telling me swirly clouds can suck up people and buildings? Wild! I spend hours and hours on YouTube watching tornado videos and documentaries. 3) Rocks. I have one million rocks. I collect at least one rock from every place I visit and they’re not labeled.

People tell her they're proud, that she's so brave, and that she has the right to be whoever she wants. Rightfully so, and I want to reiterate that I'm glad she gets to experience this. In no way do I want to minimize her hardship or claim that she does not deserve this.  <newline>  <newline> But seeing this made me realize that I want to be myself too.

164;11uhzo2;I'm working towards my autism diagnosis, but I can't seem to tell my sister;"This is my first ever post on any reddit, I think, so I hope I'm doing the formatting right haha. For the past two years, I have been doing extensive research on the autism spectrum and how to get a diagnosis. I've done all the online tests/quotients, watched tons of YouTube videos, read tons of books from my uni's library- I can't express enough how so much of my life makes sense now. <newline>  <newline> I've reflected a lot on things I did as a child like, one example, not understanding the social rules of friend circles/friends in general as a child. I also developed into becoming an extremely emotionally cut-off person in high school from all the pressure to ""fit in"" (masking like crazy). I feel 10000% confident in pursuing a diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> I recently had to tell my mom as I tried going forward with the diagnosis myself, but thanks to America's wonderful healthcare systems, I could not afford anything on my own. She was skeptical at first, asked ""And why would you think that about yourself?"". I know she means well and isn't familiar with the spectrum and has surface level knowledge. So I didn't hold her initial reaction against her cause it's such a common thing for people to believe the tropes and have very narrow views of the spectrum. Once I sat down and explained how my entire life makes sense with autism- she fully came around and is supportive. She is helping me finally get that diagnosis. So what's the problem? The whole reason I wrote this post? My sister. <newline>  <newline> My sister is 5 years younger than me and has received multiple diagnoses in the last few years. She is very open about them, but for her privacy I won't blurt them out on the internet but for the sake of clarity none of her diagnoses have been autism/Asperger's related. Part of the reason I think I went so unnoticed for so long was that my sister was a lot more vocal and outwardly sharing of her struggles. Which is totally fine- that's just how she works and I don't blame her for that. When I had that first talk with my mom, I explained to her that I felt weird about telling my sister and I didn't want her or my mom to think I was trying to steal the spotlight away after all these years. My mom even understood how there was a lot more attention on my sister and how my parents believed I was the ""normal"" one because I always kept to myself. I think this has made a wall built up between me and my sister. <newline>  <newline> I don't know how to tell her about what I'm going through because of all of this. I know it's not her fault and just a product of our brains/parenting- but I still can't seem to tell her about what I am pursuing. Since I've always been viewed as the ""normal"" one, even from her, when I ""act out"" or show ""irregular"" behavior (which I've been doing a lot more as I've become more comfortable with my actual self) she humorously calls me out and questions my behavior. To her, of course it's irregular and different cause it isn't the big sister she grew up with that showed no emotion and suppressed everything. I guess I am writing this to sort of vent about my inability to talk about this with one of the people I love most in this world cause I'm nervous that they'll blow me off and might not be as accepting. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I really don't know how to tell her. Sorry for the long post- I've been told that I write way to long of texts so I guess Reddit posts are no different.";tomatostrawb;False;0;1.0;2023-03-18 08:00:48;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11uhzo2/im_working_towards_my_autism_diagnosis_but_i_cant/;autisminwomen

I don't mean any offense with this post and let me know if it's inappropriate or needs to be removed.  <newline>  <newline> There's a couple YouTubers I notice with autistic traits who as far as I know are not openly on the spectrum or identify as autistic. It actually kind of makes me uncomfortable how much I see myself in these people. I have a lot of internalized ableism towards myself and some other autistic people and I desperately wish I could be NT. This is something I'm working on but honestly it's hard. <newline>  <newline> The first one is Jennifer Myers. I find her incredibly beautiful. I do notice that she seems to have very few social connections outside of her parents. She is extremely obsessive about her diet and lifestyle to an almost extreme degree. In her videos she will only eat things like spinach and canned sardines with oil and nothing else. Her diet seems very very restrictive. She is also very extreme with sun protection, wearing the kind of protection you see in southeast Asian countries just to go to the supermarket and walk outside for less than a few minutes in a mild climate. She also speaks in a quite controlled and unusual way to the camera and seems to give eye contact very intensely. (Almost like she's forcing it.) <newline>  <newline> Dr. Dray is another one many have commented on. She was rumored to have left one of her positions because she was considered ""odd"" and her bedside manner not very effective. She reminds me a lot of Jennifer Myers in her obsessions with sun protection and restrictive diet (many are very concerned with her extremely low body weight and odd behaviors around food such as wearing a bib, using children's utensils.) I also find her way of speaking very formal and monotone, especially for an influencer. I think she is a very intelligent and accomplished woman who has an insane amount of knowledge on dermatology but I can definitely see her struggling with everyday life. Like Jennifer Myers she seems to have no social connections outside of her mother. <newline>  <newline> One I just now considered is Kelly Stamps. Lately many have noticed odd behavior from her and speculate she may have some other kind of personality disorder or be experiencing manic episodes but tbh I relate a lot with her as an autistic woman. During certain times in my life I have developed a kind of superiority complex as if I am ""better"" than other people to protect myself from social rejection and not fitting in. I've also often been a wanderer and tried reinventing myself with moving, changing my appearance or interests/personality, believing that if I ""found"" my true self I would finally fit into neurotypical society instead of accepting who I actually am. She also seems very socially isolated, not even having much of a connection with her family.";thislimeismine;False;11;0.5;2023-03-17 23:47:12;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11u85o7/youtubers_you_think_are_on_the_spectrum/;autisminwomen

The only change is the meds.  <newline>  <newline> I saw some TikTok videos a month or so ago with this same thing happening to some of the creators I follow, but now it seems those have been deleted.  <newline>  <newline> I did some searching and all I could find was a NYTimes article about how several people think their Adderall stopped worked within the last few weeks but stating that it didn't change and everyone complaining is probably just not getting enough sleep or needs a higher dose...  <newline>  <newline> I ended up calling my pharmacist this morning to ask them if there was a change in the dosage or formula, they denied any sort of change.  <newline>  <newline> I feel like I'm being gaslit, especially now where I can't find any of those videos/posts from a few weeks ago. I really doubt that I built an intolerance to it literally overnight, right as I started a new bottle.  <newline>  <newline> Has anyone else noticed anything weird?!

168;11tshpu;Non-speaking Autistic Women?;I do speak, but often it’s very hard for me and I feel like writing is my first/natural language and verbal communication is my second language.   <newline>  <newline> I’m interested in hearing from Autistic women who don’t speak, and learning about their/your experiences.   <newline>  <newline> Most Autistic women I’ve come across online are verbal.  For example, lots of YouTube videos.  Where can I read the writings of nonverbal Autistic women?  Do you have any books to recommend?  Are there any YouTube channels run by Autistic women who communicate through AAC, text-to-speech, sign, writing, or something else? <newline>  <newline> I think a lot about what my life would be like if I grew up without speaking, or stopped speaking now as an adult, or if the people in my life “allowed” me to sometimes not speak (that is, wouldn’t get mad at me).  I wonder about whether the hardships that come with being nonverbal (such as some people treating you poorly) would be worth the benefits, which for me would be, potentially, not being so exhausted all the time.  Talking exhausts me.  But then I wonder if it’s really the talking that exhausts me, or human interaction in general.  Would interacting with others in silence exhaust me so much?

171;11rkh1x;What did I do now??;So this morning, I wrote what I thought was a nice, supportive post about the changes in my life since I realized I have ASD. I was on top of the world at that moment.  Well, that didn't last long! When I got home from getting FIRED FROM MY JOB after 7 years without so much as a verbal warning EVER, I was like, okay at least I can go to the group, tell them what happened and they will be there and listen. I will have to tell them that even though I was so happy this morning, my life continues to implode and I guess that happens to everyone at some point. I will check and see how many upvotes I got and that will help me feel a little bit better while I figure out what I'm going to do with whatever remains of my life. (I'll be 63 in June, and in the past 3 weeks I've lost my relationship of almost 22 years, my home (staying with my mom, not  homeless), survived a domestic violence situation, sprained my MCL and have been struggling to make it to work and even walk, went through a 3 year audit/survey by the state and federal government, and now been fired from my job. Get home and my post has 0 upvotes, not even the default one you give yourself. So really, what the heck??  The post was complimentary of everyone, used no profanity, asked for no diagnosis, there were no slurs because I don't use sirs unless there was a slur that I didn't know was a slur. And my post is nowhere to be found. As far as I know I haven't violated any rules. There's no messages from a bot or mod, just a vacuum.  Just a big nothing, and it wouldn't have mattered so much but now I've lost my job, so I no longer feel like a superhero or whatever. So, could vsomeone tell me, please, a mod or any members, if I've done something wrong?  If I've offended anyone in any way, I'm really sorry.  It was not my intention. I thought you would like the post.  I thought it would give everyone hope. I thought there would be pie for pi Day which I was going to provide. There was going to be ice cream to go with the pie and everyone was gone to watch the YouTube spot (Maybe that's where I went wrong I wasn't supposed to include a  link?  There was no pie, pi or or however you want to spell it at the office today. There was no ice cream, there was no YouTube video. I was pretty much shut out. Nobody talked to me. I am one of the Administrators, or at least I was. As if all this wasn't just plenty already, I then realized that I had left my laptop at my mom's.  So I went home to get it.  I've been working sort of hybrid for several years, that's why they got me the laptop. I've never been told that I was no longer allowed to work from home. So a  situation came up that I had to handle right away, so  I was trying to handle it from here. The owner called me and said I need to get back up to the office, why wasn't I there?  I was never told before that I had to work at the office all the time. So I'm like perplexed and confused about how I've hurt or upset anyone at all. I've been trying to do the right thing through a lot of adversity. My coworkers know how hard I worked to keep the place open through the pandemic, fines that were levied in error, hurricanes, floods,etc. I got blamed for something that wasn't my fault, maybe I had a part in it, but I've been begging for help and training. Now this??  Maybe there's a big misunderstanding, or my post got lost or something because I don't think I violated any rules.  If I did,  someone  please tell me. I won't do it again because I need this right now. I need support. thanks.;Oolila;False;24;0.91;2023-03-15 03:14:33;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11rkh1x/what_did_i_do_now/;autisminwomen

173;11qi2n1;I think I just found a major cheat code;And by cheat code I mean accommodation on my own iphone. <newline>  <newline> context: a conflux of experiences related to processing trauma have impacted my ability to live a full life since september 2021. what i've been engaging with in order to stave off suicidality is just harm reduction like... if terror in my body doesn't go away without excessive screen time, fine, that's clearly what u need bb, i guess that's just what we're doing. And so my phone addiction is really bad, especially tiktok, which brings a host of other problems. Disclaimer tho I am at the end of the day very pro-tiktok because of what an incredible resource it's been for us as a species to have access to each other without anything but our lived experiences and wifi. I think few things have ever affected the left's ability to make necessary progress as much as tiktok has. But I feel myself desperate to moderate my use more, and sometimes I'm actually pretty okay at it, and I'm trying to be hopeful that I can actually make real change this year. (Like, as saturn moves into pisces, if anyone here cares -- the whole, like, closure of my karmic debt repayment era thing... it has been so real for me since march 7.) <newline>  <newline> context 2: I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11pr426/just_noticed_something_about_color/) yesterday about sensitivity to light and color, and how visual informaton in a color gradient rather than color chaos is a more tolerable experience for me. <newline>  <newline> This morning, I saw a tiktok where a girl said that out of all the things she's tried to help her recover from phone addiction, the only thing that worked was turning her phone's display to greyscale. <newline>  <newline> The way I was just thinking like 2 days ago about how I wish more of my input was just... black and white. I had no idea that was an option. Even more than that, I figured out how to make a shortcut in my control panel so that i can turn the color back on if I need to. Other digital sobriety tools I've tried have been kind of a commitment, where if it's a nuisance to pause it, I won't want to turn it on. But making it this simple to turn the color on or off... I honestly think I might have just saved my life. <newline>  <newline> My experience of uncovering that I was misdiagnosed my whole life has been so wild, and it, you know, makes me really mad. One thing I'm mad about is how narrowly clinicians insist on seeing ASD. When I realize how intense my stuff with light and color is, I picture the kid in the royal tenenbaums. Bill Murray's patient. How there was maybe this moment, for little white boys, where neurodivergence sometimes meant these hyperspsecific diagnoses. The way Bill Murray paid attention to this kid's very personal way of processing the world around him... I just know that I'm never going to get that much respect. Every item on the laundry list of peculiarities and conditions just decreases the chances that other people will see me as human, or telling the truth. <newline>  <newline> I wish people were interested enough in the human mind to ask why this happens. People like to say they're very interested in it... but I just don't think they are.;CaveLady3000;False;0;1.0;2023-03-13 18:54:12;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11qi2n1/i_think_i_just_found_a_major_cheat_code/;autisminwomen

177;11pw3jj;My soul hurts.;I can’t even articulate how alone I am. Today I found out that at absolute best I am considered an afterthought to everyone in my life, and at worst an utter burden that nobody wants to deal with. It feels worse because I didn’t follow the path I wanted to when I had the chance because I felt guilty leaving those I thought cared. Now I realize they never would have noticed that I was gone anyway.  <newline>  <newline> This makes no sense because I’ve got no brain left. It hurts to write down what happened again. Because you know how everyone says, “if you’re in crisis, reach out?” I did that three different times today and explained EVERYTHING, and one person (my dad)yelled at me, one ignored me, and the other(my partner of six years) gave me a quick hug while I was choke sobbing, and went to hang out with his best friend who apparently needed him more. I’ve been alone in meltdown and solely responsible for a five year old who is also on the spectrum for the last six hours.  <newline>  <newline> I’m hungry. I haven’t eaten in two days and all that’s here is heavy bready carbs that are just a gluey lump in my stomach that I puke up immediately. I want something filling that makes me feel like someone loves me.  <newline>  <newline> What happened is my grandmother died two months ago, and ever since, my aunt has pushed me and my family out of any kind of grieving. They had her directly cremated and no kind of service. Nobody has so much as said a word to me since. They only told me in the first place because my dad didn’t pick up his phone and they were trying to find him. I literally got a call at 7 am telling me “sorry to bother you, I can’t get ahold of your father to tell him your grandmother died.” I was told there would be a memorial or something one day. Yesterday was her birthday and there was sandwiches at the house. My family (me, partner, two kids) and I were told about it, and then told explicitly not to come. I’ve been a wreck ever since.  <newline>  <newline> So I’m fighting with both my grief and the stark truth that my entire family/friends/anyone I’ve ever known has made it perfectly clear that I am nothing to them.

My only friend used me for 20 years and just decided to start ignoring my texts one day.  <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what I did. To any of them. I would never dream of treating them like this.

Great evidence of autism but not great for much else. <newline>  <newline> So I went to the practice to pick up the questionnaire and when I looked at it I couldn't believe how short it was. Most of you in the UK have probably had to fill it out too. It was ten questions and you had to tick where you agreed or disagreed (mildly or strongly) with the statements. It infuriated me, not only because the doctor could have gone through it with me on the phone but also because the questions were so broad and hard to understand. Some questions were easy like ""I often notice small sounds when others do not."" That one is an obvious: ""strongly agree."" But the rest were not so easy. What does it really mean to be a ""big picture"" person vs a ""detail-oriented"" person? Not only that, but most of the questions were formulated as follows: ""I experience x when others do not."" Now please tell me how I am meant to know what other people experience? How do I know if I can read people ""correctly"" when no one ever tells me exactly how they feel? How the hell can I ""work out what other people are thinking"" by their facial expressions?! <newline>  <newline> Maybe this just confirms that I am autistic because I cannot give straightforward answers to these questions but I really feel this way of assessing people is all wrong. It's bureaucratic. It's a one-size-fits-all approach. I'm especially made because I know these kinds of questions are more tailored to males than females. I also believe that many neurotypical people would also struggle to answer these questions accurately because there is no part where you can ""justify your answer."" I could say that I believe I'm good at reading facial expressions because I've never been told otherwise and this makes me believe I must be doing alright. A neurotypical person could say likewise. <newline>  <newline> I calculated my score and in the end I scored 7 out of 10, high enough to be referred for a diagnosis. I purposefully didn't cheat on the test by reading how to get a high score, despite worrying that I might not ""pass"" (ironic, I know). I repeatedly score high on the apsie quiz (which is far more comprehensive) and definitely relate to a lot of female autistic Youtubers. And I had written loads of notes about things I experienced in childhood that would definitely be more helpful to someone wondering if I am autistic. I'm just very frustrated at the way we adults have to go about getting a diagnosis. It doesn't feel very intuitive. <newline>  <newline> Can anyone else relate to feeling frustrated at the bureaucracy prohibiting us from receiving help/a diagnosis?

187;11m9ei3;The mind fuck of discovering I’m autistic;Just recently realized I’m most definitely autistic (self diagnosed) as well as ADHD (formally diagnosed). I have mixed feelings on it:  <newline>  <newline> 1) Mostly relief - because I’ve named yet another demon in my life <newline>  <newline> 2) Excitement - because psychoanalyzing myself has always been what I now recognize as a special interest <newline>  <newline> 3) Vindication - because now I recognize a lot of my traits as autistic and not because I’m a “bad person”.  <newline>  <newline> 4) I also feel self conscious and sad - both for the little girl who wasn’t diagnosed, and also because I have to unpack a lot of internalized stigma about autistic people.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I’ve always associated autism with the “weird kid” in class, and I’ve spent so so so many years trying so hard not to be that kid. Knowing that I am that kid, just wearing a normal person costume, is kind of a hard pill to swallow. I feel terrible for judging them, but I realize I probably did because I saw shared traits in them that I buried behind my mask and I hated them for it. I should point out I was never a bully. In fact, despite being quiet and unassuming most of the time, I’ve lost my temper a few times on bullies picking on the “weird kid” growing up. I’ve always chalked it up to my crazy sense of justice, which it was, but I realize now it’s because I was also standing up for myself through that bullied kid. Deep down I related to the weirdness. But even after standing up for them, I would go out of my way to avoid being their friend. I didn’t want a target on my back either. Being friends with them would highlight how weird I am, too, and I just wanted to hide behind my mask. Conversely, I always admired my (also undiagnosed autistic) sister, who never cared and would always reach out to the weird kid… because she also related. I used to wish I could be like that, I still do.  <newline>  <newline> My sister has such a strong network of neurodivergent friends as an adult, and I envy her for it. I have two close friends, and while they may be on the spectrum, they’re deeply masked. I don’t think they’d want to take off their masks either. While I love my besties like my sisters, I’ve always felt a disconnect with them. I’ve always wished for a friend who would fully understand and embrace me for who I am. Which is not the neurotypical cis hetero woman that I’ve always tried to be! With this realization about myself, I’m going to try to meet more fellow neurodivergent people. I’m going to consciously put aside my biases and open to up other fellow “weirdos”. I’m going to try to take off my mask and let people see my true “weird” self.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve been unmasking for the past few years without realizing. In 2016 I had what i now recognize as an autistic burnout, which led me on a journey of self discovery and healing, which has eventually led me here! <newline> I’ve stopped trying to be friends with everyone, I’ve become more discerning of people I want to be friends with, I value my solace and don’t feel self conscious for it. I also dress in really bright loud clothes now! Not the Pinterest-perfect white girl style (which is beautiful but let’s be honest, my Persian ass doesn’t need to be dying my hair blonde so I can look like my white friends or conform to western beauty standards. I’m a babe in my own Persian way) that I used to emulate.  <newline>  <newline> I’m an “Adult Disney Woman” and I fucking love it! I don’t care if it’s weird that I’m obsessed with Forky from Toy Story. I wear my Mickey Mouse shoes with pride. My house is decorated with loud and random objects of things my husband (also on spectrum) and I fixate on. It’s funny how the things I used to think were lame, people now point and say “I love your (x)!!” Because they’re actually cool and authentic!  <newline>  <newline> I’ve found so much happiness in my authenticity already, and knowing I’m autistic is only going to make that even better. I’m really excited for this journey and I know it’s going to make me a much happier and fulfilled person.;WeiWeiSmoo;False;7;0.95;2023-03-08 21:54:02;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11m9ei3/the_mind_fuck_of_discovering_im_autistic/;autisminwomen
188;11l1pcn;Help please- how do I help my daughter to express more scrutiny to what she hears and reads?;Hello, I am in the process of diagnosis and my daughter, 11, was diagnosed last year.  <newline>  <newline> She is bright as a button academically and does quite well with the social side too although that is where some help is needed.  <newline>  <newline> There is an emerging trait that me and her Dad have noticed that is worrying us. It is information scrutiny.  <newline>  <newline> For example she told us very excitedly that she had just learned Thomas Jefferson’s favourite meal was mac and cheese and fought with us when we said that was quite unlikely. Turns out she had watched a YouTube short where someone had created a completely false set of videos about historical figures but in a believable way.  <newline>  <newline> So I thought ‘how can I help her?’ And I shared an infographic that is about news integrity (who is telling you this ‘fact’? Why might they want you to know that? What do they benefit by telling you that?) and asked her to consider that when she’s watching stuff.  <newline>  <newline> But it’s fed into real life and I’m worried for teenhood. She believes everything her friends tell her, even when they are obviously false.  <newline>  <newline> For example her friend told her she’d been to see the masked singer at the weekend and knew the winner. A silly lie.  The series was filmed the year before and no one knew the winner. Her friend was bragging and that’s fine, they are 11. The problem is that she will argue when you try to challenge.  <newline>  <newline> So I’m asking for help ladies.

193;11jerou;Hobbies shame and isolation, anyone else giving up on irl friends and embracing online friends?;"TLDR: Im beginning to embrace my preference for online relationships over irl ones, maybe you can relate? Maybe with healthy online boundaries, we can live healthy social lives even if the majority of our friends are online. My hobbies are very nerdy and I rarely find people to relate to irl. I still feel a sense of shame for this though, due to societies preference for ""social butterflies"" with lots of friends. How can we overcome it? Im going to try and be more shameless. <newline>  <newline> Ever since I was a child, I never felt connected with my peers. Not in my hometown, maybe a little bit more in college but still struggled, and now in my young adult years, it's even worse. I've always had an easier time fostering online friendships, however, never felt like I could embrace that because being ""chronically online"" is so shameful and of course, irl communication is essential for social skills and health, I dont deny that. But Ive met many online friends irl and some of my few friends from childhood are now strictly online due to distance. I feel so connected to them yet society, mainly people I meet irl and my partners idea of friendship, doesnt deem these relationships to be equal to irl. <newline>  <newline> But I just don't feel connected with anyone irl: I don't have a lot in common with people I meet irl. I've gone through phases in life where I have forced myself to get out and connect with irl people and foster friendships with those I have things in common with, but the effort has always turned out to be more than what it's worth. Most of my hobbies are very nerdy and more common for men, not that I dont have feminine interests too, but I find I generally dont have as much in common with women and hanging out with men simply isnt an option, as this has always led to romantic interest on their end. Ive spent my early adulthood basically adopting a friends of an ex longterm partner. I thought I liked this friend group as many of the friends we made together, but this ex ended up blatantly cheating on me with everyone and anyone he didnt cheat on with me with knew, so obviously I dropped them all when I found out. This was like dozens of people. Then the pandemic hit, I got very sick, and was deep into working full time and my career. I dont miss these POSs, but I miss having dance partners, coffee dates, and camping buddies. But I havent been in a position to build up a new friend group ever since, until now. <newline>  <newline> Now Im at a point where I am doing well in my career, have a longterm partner and happy relationship who has their own friends, my health is great after a long time of struggling, and my partner & I are finally talking about me ""getting out there"" and making my own friends. My partner has expressed this  would make them very happy and I understand why, as I know its exhausting to be my one and only friend I can confide in. Mind you, I have no family and only a small handful of childhood friends I see rarely. In our entire 1.5 year relationship, Ive only gone out with my own friends twice, because I dont have a lot of friends. He goes out with his friends often and while Im invited always, I dont go more times than not, because it just doesnt interest me. My partner is a musician and I get weird vibe from all his friends that theyre just not interested in pursuing a friendship in me because I have nothing in common with them and to that I say -- fair enough lol. Theyre all artists and despite the fact I love all types of art, Ive never vibed with artist cliques and their social hierarchies. But unfortunately, the typical person who shares my hobbies, isnt out dancing and doing fun stuff with their community, theyre online like me lol. But when I do go out with them, I do try and enjoy myself, it just never comes without massive exhaustion. <newline>  <newline> So I run an online business and networking online is a big part of my work. Im one of the lucky autistics whose interest aligns with their job. Over the lockdowns, I was able to make genuine friendships with influencers in my niche. But Ive stopped talking to them all because Ive felt pressured to never foster online relationships. But after struggling the last 6 months with trying to strike up conversations with strangers irl in hopes of making friends lol, trying to vibe with my partners friends, trying Bumble BFF, trying to connect with old friends ... Im just giving up. Im simply starting to lose interest. I find myself wishing I was at home and talking to people here on Reddit or my other social channels where its less anonymous lol. I find myself looking forward to Discord hangouts, online networking events, hackathons, talking with fellow influencers in my niche, etc. I genuinely love catching up with fellow creators like myself. Even though the lines are a little blurred between personal & professional life, Im starting to prefer it because it aligns with my hobbies, excludes me from all the social hierarchy nonsense, and is accessible on bad sensory days when I cant leave the house lol. Its not my fault that people dont understand my situation. I think a lot of people equate having online social lives with the stereotypical, unproductive argumentative reply guy, mental-illness obsessed, ""Reddit bro"" stereotype who has zero social skills. But thats not my case, I am genuinely making constructive friends online and the more energy Ive put into them, the more awesome my life gets. Where as the more energy Ive put into irl friends, the most exhausting and unauthentic my live has gotten. <newline>  <newline> Im starting to think, why not just go all in on this? Lately Ive been limiting my online social time and for what? I dont see the point anymore. Ill keep going out every two weeks for events but you know what? I want to spend this Saturday on Discord doing cool shit with my online friends lol. I think Im going to spend MORE time online and you know what? Im not going to feel bad about it anymore. If my partner or anyone I meet in the future judges me for it, its on them. Its better than having no friends and as long as I leave the house every 2 weeks for some sort of event, whether alone or not, then Im going to start being more shameless about being chronically online lol. <newline>  <newline> Sorry for the rant, I blame coffee lol.";Ok-Anybody1132;False;2;0.88;2023-03-05 21:41:08;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11jerou/hobbies_shame_and_isolation_anyone_else_giving_up/;autisminwomen

195;11ht5be;Appropriate message to send or not? Please help!;I have one proper friend (not a work friend, and someone who is my own friend and not my mum’s friend that I meet up with sometimes to hang out). She’s referred to me as one of her best friends before, which made me really happy because she’s my best friend. I tend to see her every couple of months usually, give or take, but haven’t seen her for longer than usual - we’ve been in touch but I’ve noticed the past maybe month or two she hasn’t been messaging as much. She’s said before that when she’s struggling she shuts off from friends for a bit, she did this a while back and after explained about it and how her and her partner had been having issues. I understand and don’t mind: we all have our own ways of coping like I said to her at the time. I’m not the sort of person who needs to talk to/see a friend all the time anyway, I can happily go weeks without talking providing things were left on a good note and I know we’re still friends. But I’ve had multiple ‘best friends’ ghost me in the past so I do get insecure and worry that she’ll do the same sometimes. I seem to pick up on small shifts in energy and overthink it and assume that person doesn’t want to be my friend any more, when I’ve learnt from the past that often it’s not about me at all. I’m usually pretty good at hiding that side of me nowadays though. <newline>  <newline> But anyway, late last night (it’s now early morning here) I clicked onto her facebook profile, I think it was to check she hadn’t unfriended me IIRC - actually I feel like maybe that was part of the reason but I also remember having a really weird feeling that her and her partner might have broken up and wanted to check although that sounds crazy - and her profile says single and I’m pretty sure it didn’t before. And so does her partner’s. It was getting late but I care and I figured we’re close and I don’t want her to feel she has to avoid me until she tells me what’s happened (think it’s socially acceptable to message her late as we’ve messaged eachother late before) and I basically said something about how I was clicking through stuff on facebook, ended up on hers, and saw it says she’s single. That maybe it’s a glitch but I remember her saying they were having problems a while back and I’m here if she needs a friend. Think I also threw in that I miss her. <newline>  <newline> She hadn’t read it last night but was likely asleep by then, and don’t want to look just yet to see if she’s read it yet as don’t want to go down an anxiety rabbithole, although if she reads it first thing in the morning I’m not expecting an instant reply, I just wanted to know if I’ve committed a social faux pas or if this was okay? Like was it weird to go on her fb profile even though we’re friends on there and I was only looking at what all her fb friends can see? Was it weird to message her that when she hasn’t told me they broke up yet? Or is that what a good/best friend would do? <newline>  <newline> Sorry for the ramblings, I’m just so unsure of myself nowadays after past experiences with best friends.

199;11gbsch;Sensory Issues with TV?;Hi, I am diagnosed autistic (20) and I live with my mum and my younger sister (and a new baby brother now too). Everything is very chaotic and I've been very tired, and I've been having this issue over the past several months or so. <newline>  <newline> My sister is almost entirely the opposite of me - this is most obvious in the energy levels of the two of us. My sister is very high energy where I am extremely low energy. It's often pointed out that I am extremely quiet, which is a large part of why I was undiagnosed until 18. We now have very high suspicions that my sister has ADHD which explains a lot. <newline>  <newline> My problem has been with watching TV recently. We've been having a lot of trouble getting my sister into school so she's been home all day every day for quite a while now, and she constantly wants to be watching something on the TV, usually a movie (which is already a problem for me because of my anxiety causing an aversion to watching movies), but even now she's been wanting to watch shorter YouTube videos like I want to watch, I've been struggling with psyching myself up for it. She asks to watch something and I'm immediately overcome with dread. <newline>  <newline> I prefer to spend my time listening to music, but she says she gets bored and I usually can get about an hour in only before she asks if we can switch to watching something instead (for context, I usually listen to music out loud in the living room because my mum doesn't mind this: I don't like separating myself in my bedroom because I was constantly made to feel bad for that during my teen years by being called anti-social and moody). I understand that I obviously understand that it's not always my choice but my reasoning is that she shouldn't even be at home anyway, so it wouldn't be an issue in ordinary circumstances because she would be at school.  <newline>  <newline> I was just wondering if this is a sensory issue thing that anybody else might experience, or if it's just some unrelated symptom of my mental health issues. It's just, like, the idea of putting something on the TV, even something I should like, is very stressful to me and especially over the past two days has made me feel like I'm on the brink of a meltdown.

201;11etjm5;Ugh I hate exercising;I’m not blaming this on my autism and I also understand there are many autistic people who love exercise.  <newline>  <newline> What I am wondering about is the mental rumination before exercise.  <newline> I think about how I don’t want to get up, all of the different things I need to do in order to exercise, change clothes, YouTube video, etc. then I think about how I “will feel” once I start. This is an entire different rumination rabbit hole, where it’s a hyper focus on how my body will feel- sweating is uncomfortable for me, breathing heavier, etc. I do walk and have tried that for consistent exercise, but the mental rumination then turns to other “issues” .  I have seriously ruminated about “ but what if I like it too much and can’t continue doing it”  <newline>  <newline> I know that exercise helps me because I’ve done it consistently for bursts of 1 to 2 months periods, then I struggle for the rest of the 10 months in the year trying to “understand” why I don’t exercise. I have a history of stopping something and feeling like I fucked up so, I won’t start it again. I have some black and white thinking so it’s hard for me to do things sporadically without feeling like, I  never doing it again” if I take a break.  <newline>  <newline> The rumination in hopes to “understand” why I don’t exercise is what drives me bonkers. And the acknowledgment that I am addicted to this rumination (addicted sounds intense) because I can’t tolerate or want to avoid being in my body is really disappointing.  <newline>  <newline> I have cptsd. I have some coping skills that sometimes cause harm.  “internal drugstore”, also the victim triangle and how I tend to default to the victim role when I am faced with imagined, real or perceived interpersonal conflict. I can acknowledge some of the internal obstacles and defense patterns that truly keep me stuck and perpetuating harm to myself and others. I don’t have too much shame about the defense patterns,  i understand I am a survivor of at times, abusive family dynamics and that was never my fault,and I am the only one responsible for my solution. I believe exercise could be part of the solution for me.  <newline>  <newline> Exercise has been a struggle for years. My relationship to dissociation is long and complex and has been a coping skill since childhood. For years I thought I was living, but I was actually in a dissociative haze. Years ago, I used to go on silent retreats for days but after doing trauma work have realized, during those retreats I wasn’t in my body. I was basically sitting there and being quiet. I was not at all connected to my body just in my head, trying to “think” away my trauma. The spiritual bypass was real for me and I didn’t even know it at the time. My perfectionism was exasperated, by going to these retreats it kept the image up, “I’m doing deep work”  <newline>  <newline> Anyone struggle with feeling safe in your body while you exercise?  <newline> Is this a possible sensory issue?  <newline> Is this just the victim mentality and I am wasting time and wanting pity because I’m not exercising?  <newline>  I am avoiding exercise, because I prefer to write about this on Reddit or watch YouTube videos for hits of dopamine, basically an excuse to dissociate?  <newline>  <newline> I’ve spent so many journal page “understanding” this issue, purchasing of equipment I don’t use, feeling the benefits of exercise to just stop doing it. I have tried to help myself remember how good I feel after exercising. I even remind my inner kids that although it’s uncomfortable we just do it for a little while so we can feel better afterwards. Some of my inner kids love exercise!  <newline>  <newline> I even have unused and unfinished star charts because I don’t reach my goal. I really like star charts :) So I’m reaching out to strangers on the internet.   <newline>  <newline> Also, anyone have experience of spiritually bypassing and not knowing it? I am newly diagnosed autistic and I don’t know if this also relates to masking.;Forward-Return8218;False;1;0.92;2023-03-01 03:57:36;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11etjm5/ugh_i_hate_exercising/;autisminwomen

203;11e9td0;Change Management at Work;We have to do mandatory LinkedIn Learning trainings at work and one of the learning pathways is change management. All of the courses so far have been focused on embracing change and learning to shift your mindset to be flexible...👀 <newline>  <newline> Honestly, a lot of these courses seem to be designed to help people begin to examine why the change is difficult and to become more aware of how they react to change. I feel like I spend so much time on internal examination, especially since getting diagnosed that these courses aren't helpful. <newline>  <newline> I feel like I have tools and coping mechanisms to handle change when it occurs and I don't hate all change. I mostly struggle with change mandated by others, especially if I don't understand or disagree with the reasons for the change. However, I don't foresee any amount of mindset shifting that will suddenly make change internally easier for me. I can mask and modulate my external reactions to the change, though. <newline>  <newline> I wanted to vent, but also to see if anyone else has had similar issues at work or in life.;LLLBerkshires;False;0;1.0;2023-02-28 15:01:09;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11e9td0/change_management_at_work/;autisminwomen
204;11dy65l;When NTs' communication style stops you from ever entering the conversation, but you had really important things to say... 😭;"One afternoon last week I took a really good walk in the sunshine that cleared my head helped regulate my body and then came home, did some chores and tidying type tasks ... and then I wrote & refined an important realization/ clearer description of the how and why of my recent involuntary separation from my former employer of 5 years.  <newline> -How it was unfair, and hand's unskillfully and (unintentionally?) discriminatory from a perspective of gender and disability <newline> - How it is impacting me personally and professionally  <newline> - and some of my thoughts on how it presents and what it affects in the larger contexts of professional employment and business culture ... <newline> And then I had to pivot away from that because it was really intense and was starting to bring up emotions that I didn't have the resources to process in that moment, so I let myself fidget scroll for a while.  <newline> So, I was stimming and brain twiddling and basking in the quiet of my alone time in my living room and the sensation of petting my very soft cat. I had fallen into hyper-focus on the activist side of Instagram... (I call this hope scrolling instead of doom scrolling, the content is better but the habit is still just as dysfunctional)... <newline>   <newline> Then my mom called back (we had chatted briefly that morning ) <newline> I answered and she opened with a question that didn't make sense to me:""How was your big adventure?"" <newline> Huh? (because I hadn't switched back to compensating for neurotypical communication)    Not immediately understanding that she was asking how my walk and my afternoon went... <newline>  <newline> Since I hadn't had anything I would call an adventure, and didn't understand that she was talking about my walk, I asked for clarification ""Adventure? What do you mean?"" <newline>  ... she was frustrated and flummoxed by me not understanding & being able to answer the question right away...  <newline> which restimulated the calculate catalogue of memories I have of people being confused by my need for clarification because it contradicts their concept of my intelligence.  <newline> I was just trying to catch up to her metaphor and find words -  and wound up in a very baffled semi-mute mind state. She continued to fire questions at me as I was trying to respond, but there were gaps between my sentences, as each time I tried to pivot to the most recent question... that resulted in me just leaving longer gaps (silent or breathed pauses) in the conversation. I was trying to spend the time to decode her metaphorical question ...but she couldn't wait for that to happen and instead decided to tell me ""How difficult it is FOR HER when there are big gaps in the conversation, where I just don't say anything."" That she had ""Just meant to check in about how the day went, but since I this very uncomfortable communication pattern is happening, maybe we should just hang up.""  <newline> I said ""Okay, then we should hang up, because that won't change. I can't remove the gaps between my words because sometimes that is just how long it takes me to process an idea and create a response."" <newline> She did not enjoy this reply.  <newline>   <newline> When that happens it's me trying to find and vet the right expression to blend into and accommodate the neurotypical conversation style.  <newline> By asking a question in a format that I didn't understand and being frustrated and impatient about my need for clarification and my halting response, she short circuited what could have been a conversation where we both got some of our needs for communication met.  <newline> Instead, we just skipped forward from her impatience with my lack of responses to something that was more comfortable for her - talking about how she was doing and her day.   <newline>  <newline> I really would have liked to talk to her about what I wrote about accepting and supporting neurodivergence in the workplace, and how my termination conversation and the last 6 months at that job went...and what I had uncovered and was finally able to express about that in what I wrote this afternoon.  <newline>  <newline> Instead she talked about what she had gotten done so far that, and what she would be doing next, what she was planning on making for dinner. I mostly made encouraging. I'm listening type noises. We had a couple more weird word misunderstandings and turnarounds until her food was ready and it was time to go... <newline> And we hung up. <newline>  <newline> There were no places for me to enter the conversation that made any sense, no uncamouflaged questions, so I didn't get to speak about how my day actually did go and what was going on for me. <newline>  <newline> Now, having just hung up, I have the anxious energy of agitation and sadness of isolation draining resources and compromising my capacity for executive function....  <newline> So, I'm having an incredibly difficult time figuring out which of my physical needs to try to meet first ...  <newline> Address how cold the downstairs is by moving stuff away from the heater in the dining area so that I can turn it on at the same time that the front baseboard is on -  <newline> or  <newline> Find some food to eat in an admittedly chaotic kitchen because it's been too long since since cereal this morning and I'm hungry.  <newline> Cold and hunger. Two very intense, mostly negative sensory experiences that each have specific and intense negative impacts on my ability to process information or access motivation for activity (necessary or recreational) <newline>  Cold and hunger are both huge detriments to my executive functioning capabilities.  <newline>  <newline> Sometimes I feel like talking about the effects of being undiagnosed until my late 40s isn't welcome. In fact, it seems that my mom sees it as me becoming a victim on purpose, or blaming her for not getting me the help I needed when I was a little kid, or being voluntarily impaired or helpless to get attention.  <newline> She seems to view my identification with and attempt at acceptance of some of my autistic traits as being intentionally self-limiting, like I'm just using something that I've read about as an excuse for my struggles with clutter (that I am in fact working diligently on - including paid organizer help and a support group) and time management/ prioritization. Or she tells me that there are just too many things. Too many sounds. Too many situations that overstimulate me , And she tells me that I'm not doing therapy often enough.... Which is absurd because I don't think I can handle more than two therapist appointments a week and still have any spoons left for interacting with the rest of the world.  <newline>  <newline> I understand that her words and her opinion carry too much weight in the way that I think of myself. Sometimes this fact has kept me just barely back from the edge of danger but frequently it has the effect of causing me to doubt my own experiences and observations of myself in the exact same ways that so many people's judgments about my capacity and my intention and my potential have (ever since I was very young- I got labeled with ""gifted but not living up to potential"" as early as second grade - but did anyone look deeper to figure out why? Maybe because I'm effing neurodivergent!).  <newline>  <newline> There's got to be a difference between acknowledging self-doubt and doing it anyway and not being able to trust my own perception of what my capacity is because it doesn't match somebody else's goals or desire for me.   <newline>  <newline> Conversations are smoother and she stays calmer when I am hard burning my own resources and pushing myself to communicate in a style that is more familiar and accommodating of neurotypical standards. <newline>  <newline> The fact that it's just too hard for her to interact with me when I'm not masking ...

I don't know much about exercise.  <newline> I at first thought she was referring to herself, like either the situation was uncomfortable and making her angry, or she was trying to, like, pump herself up?

210;11cmygs;“Use an Uber, save a friendship”;So recently I’ve seen a few of these posts debating on if you should ask friends to get you at the airport. [This, for example.](https://twitter.com/codie_sanchez/status/1629563662200451075?s=46&t=2j9JLX_J3sDaqAOMbD_awQ) <newline>  <newline> Obviously a lot of the reactions to posts like that are negative.

The OP of that tweet, they say it’s bad friend behaviour to ask people to pick you up at the airport. From what i dan tell, it’s because you’re making your friend drive far at an inconvenient hour. Why is that? I don’t really get it. If you aren’t able to pick up the friend just tell them you can’t. Is this a neurotypical thing: the implication that you must do every thing a friend asks of you? I don’t get where people who agree with the title of this post are coming from when they act personally offended at being asked to do something.

213;11b719y;Ugh. *clothes* I hate dealing with clothes;"I generally don't talk about these things because people don't understand, but maybe someone here will get it. <newline>  <newline> I have 4 pairs of pants. Two winter two summer. That's it. <newline>  <newline> They're actually all the exact same model of pants, but two pairs are men's two pair are women's. This is relevant, but I'll get to that later. <newline>  <newline> They're hiking pants, so made of a quick dry material so I can go out in the rain or weather. I can made spontaneous decisions to cut through a park where there are a lot of brambles and things that would damage normal pants. They're stretchy so I can climb over things. For some reason I seem to randomly wind up in situations where I need to climb over something and usually it's kinda dirty, so I don't want to be wearing normal clothes doing this. These pants tend to brush dirt and stains off easily. I like them because they look nice enough to wear to work, and I don't ever have to choose what pair of pants I need to wear for the day, or need to change them when I'm changing activities. I just put them on in the morning and whatever I do that day is fine. <newline>  <newline> The gender they're made for is also relevant. The men's has useable pockets of course. I like wearing cargo pants because I need an extra pocket or two on the leg. I can assign different things different pockets so I can pat my pockets and know that I have everything. Each item gets a home pocket. I have executive function issues and am always forgetting this, this is my hack for that.  <newline>  <newline> The mens version is also made of thick, durable material, which means they last much longer than the womens, but are unbearably hot and not very breathable above a certain temperature. In the coldest part of winter I wear them with thin sweatpants, these are the same ""shape"" as the pants so static cling does not affect the way the pants ""drape"". (I have yet to be able to find a replacement for these sweatpants and they're full of holes and falling apart, they're thin, but warm, they don't pill, the material feels pleasant, and they're cut a specific way that I like). If I wear leggings then parts of the pants stick to the leggings and I feel restricted in movement, and I freaking hate it. As for the pants themselves, I would wear them year round if I could, but they're too hot. <newline>  <newline> The women's version of these pants are oddly extremely thin material and more fitted. They're the same model as the men's, named the same, except that they're for women instead of men. The pockets are barely useable, they're a bit bigger than usual due to the fact that they're hiking pants. I generally am not fond of them, but they're perfect for summer. For some reason men's pants are usually too thick and unbearably hot for summer. <newline>  <newline> I was happy with this arrangement for a few years, when a pair wore out was able to replace them. The company was conservative so they tended to stick to making the same things over and over, which I liked. <newline>  <newline> However, the pandemic happened and then they started having quality issues. Then a number of their stores closed. I had a system, I often couldn't find my size or the item I wanted try out in store to see if it was workable, so I'd order it online and return it to the store for free. However, all the accessible locations near me closed, and the shipping to return/exchange the items is insane. On top of that every single thing had changed and I could no longer predict what style and size fit. I used to have a good guess about 50% of the time. Now most things didn't fit. And I hate having to call customer service, they're reaching for the bottom of the barrel, high turnover, no one cares, no one is trained, and by trained I mean they couldn't figure out how to process the return, I sat with them on the phone for a half hour, and I don't know what they did but I heard them talking through it. I have to call multiple times because something is wrong, etc. <newline>  <newline> I have one pair of men's pants that are the old version that I like, and I do not like the new version. So what happens is that I wear the old version more and avoid the new version. This is problematic because I may get them dirty or spill things on them and I'm loathe to switch pants.  <newline>  <newline> Today they smelled so bad I had to rip them off my body, so I can only imagine what other people had to endure. In this case I had put them on in a hurry and run out the door before I realized it. I've been kinda depressed and exhausted lately, so forcing myself to wear the uncomfortable pants is getting harder. I'm more in the mentality, is it really that bad that they smell, maybe no one will notice (of course they'll fucking notice), but I'm having trouble bringing myself to care of late. And I do have a bit more sensitive sense of smell than others, so it's easier to convince myself no one will notices. Because I'll smell something and be like how can you stand it??? And people will be like whaaa. Sometimes I have days where I feel they deserve to smell my stinky pants because I have to deal with their shit. But generally I'm aware there are other people like me and I don't want to put them through that. <newline>  <newline> So now I have to find a new place to buy pants. I fucking hate this. I had a nice system with the old ones, and also they were reliable. It took me years to find pants that fit me the way I want them to fit, because apparently I have abnormal interests in how I want my clothes to fit, so it's very difficult to find something.  <newline>  <newline> I've already checked out the couple hiking stores that are an hour away and one is more for wealthy people who drive audis or mercedes SUVs to the trail. I get ignored or looked down upon by the staff. I returned something years ago and never got refunded and was given the run around. So fuck them. The other is a local store, so if they don't have something, I can't order it online, unless I go to another company, and I hate doing that. <newline>  <newline> I've looked at travel clothing, but it seems more geared towards a certain profile of people that doesn't fit me. It seems they either cater to young and slim instagram digital nomads with money, or middle aged boomer women. I'm middle aged and different generation (both a different style and different personality/outlook/values) so not my style. Not only do I find the clothes uncomfortable but I don't want to draw those people to me. I borrowed someone's clothes once when my baggage was lost, and dealing with people who approached me, assuming I'm like them but I find their values and things they say repellent... I guess as most people do... because I often hear remarks about them to that effect... It's much easier when they look at me and go, I think I'll avoid her, she seems like someone who I would hate, and they leave me the hell alone. Man was I glad when I got my clothes back. Had no idea how much they shielded me from awful people till that experience.  <newline>  <newline> I've also looked at tactical clothing, I find that tactical clothing tends to fit more like uniforms, which is basically made to fit you exactly wrong in every are of your body, particularly if you're a woman who has hips and boobs. There's also the element of not being sure who I'll draw to me with this style. Given that I've already been accused in the past of having a military look, like it was apparently a strange thing, and I didn't have any problems with it then. I think most people avoided approaching me, and if they did they treated me respectfully, which is what I prefer. <newline>  <newline> I did find a store sort of in my area, but worst of all it's in one of the busiest malls. And that area is just full of very awful entitled people. They have a known reputation for this, it's not just me, it's literally everyone who feels this way. Not to mention it will cost me about 40 dollars round trip (or more?) to get there and back, and the trains are infrequent. It hardly seems worth it. Though that mall contains the one location of the store I used to buy  my pants from. I'm tempted to try on pants there and see if they fit. If I am able to find something that will last me the next 3 years that would be great! I can defer dealing with having to find different clothes, that seems worthwhile to me. <newline>  <newline> The bottom line: I just don't understand how people enjoy shopping for clothing, it's just so painfully awful.  <newline>  <newline> Not to mention I also have to replace all my hoodies, I have a summer, a fall/spring, and a winter, and they've all worn out. I'm very particular about my hoodies. It's very hard to find ones I like. I've been looking for 3 years now and still am wearing the old ratty ones because I can't find something that works for me. <newline>  <newline> I kinda felt better the other day when someone on youtube talked about having to find a new hoodie when the old one felt so comfortable. I guess that makes it sound mild, it was really a massive ordeal for them that other people don't seem to have to go through.

215;11abzc3;Theory about pruning and stimming;Okay so I saw a post about how autistics don't go through as much neural pruning during toddlerhood as NTs do. And then I scrolled down and saw this video: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Co49sL9j9pa/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= of a toddler experiencing delight and awe. And... that baby moves exactly how I move when I experience those emotions and I'm fully unmasked. I feel fearful of even talking about this because I hate how we get infantilized, and it almost feels like the kind of thing a eugenicist would misconstrue and use for their evil means. (Please don't come up in here with your nonsense, eugenicists). But like.

Sometimes the music is good, so it doesn’t bother me when I have to remind it many times. <newline>  <newline> I notice, once I get the recipe down, I don’t have to use the recipe anymore. But if I go over a month of not making it, I will completely forget the recipe. This happens a lot, my fridge has over 5 smoothie recipes taped on it. I think I might make a recipe box 🤔. <newline>  <newline> I don’t have the capacity to be spontaneous when it comes to food. I also think for certain spices I tend to forget how they taste in order to recognize the name in my mind. Without a recipe, I am apt to start choosing spices based my interest in the color or texture of the spice versus the taste I want. Or I need to sample the spice, even if I used it before.  <newline>  <newline> For years I used to cook meat and knew a few go to recipes and knew how to make meat on the stove top. Years of not cooking meat, I have forgotten the process of fluctuating the heat during the cook time. <newline>  <newline> For the longest time I attributed my kitchen anxiety to the my childhood trauma, I have cptsd and years of therapy.  My mother never wanted me in the kitchen while she cooked. I often asked if I could help her in the kitchen and she was very cold, or would say in contemptuous tone, “what could you possibly do to help me in the kitchen?!”  This went in for years until I stopped asking. She did teach me how to make eggs and oatmeal. As a teen, I was burned eggs and oatmeal because I didn’t cook frequently enough to remember the recipe or  how high heat needed to be, etc. I was the scapegoat, when I burned food my mother, step father and sometimes brother would collude to make fun of me “always” burning something. <newline>  <newline> I am newly diagnosed and I see in many ways how my childhood trauma created a layer removing me from the understanding how ASD really shows up in my life.

223;1168k3c;trying to get ingrained and not succeeding (and getting triggered);" <newline>  <newline> I was in a group of people and I found it super hard to participate in conversations. I saw that there were some people that were able to exchange some slight discussions with me and I'd try to stay around them and come in the group when they came too.. One of those people started being very mean to me. Then whenever I spoke to her she'd make weird movements and she would turn her head away. One time her friend sat next to her at the table and I sat alone. She said ""it must be very bad to sit on your own"" with a bitter face. <newline>  <newline> Some of the other people in the group started to tell me I'm boring and too serious and in the group chat when I said I'll go out, a girl would send eye roll emojis and she kept removing me from the chat. Also 2 people would smirk whenever I was talking. In a way ""let's see what else stupid she'll say"". <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I was going out with them for about 7 months and it was very difficult.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> So recently I joined a discord server which was a small community. Few members and people were close.  And some things  that triggered me and reminded me of that group. There were some members from my area and one of them was looking for online friends to meet up with and she didn't approach me. Plus she had weird ableist opinions, such as that neurodivergents have weak and faulty working minds. I was also seeing with whom I can exchange some discussions and I participated more when they were there. One of them started being mean to me and sent cringe emojis when I made communication mistakes.  <newline>  <newline> It reminded me of that group of friends and triggered me. I get so stressed out when I face rejection cause it's like the world still reminds me that I'm not allowed to be a part of it.  <newline>  <newline> I think a huge reason I get isolated is because I'm not able to participate in all of their bonding activities. I have developed some patterns that would help me get ingrained in the group better but they only work superficially. Like the one where I try to participate when someone we had conversations with is present. But we don't really bond, we just exchange a few times some words... so they don't see me as their actual friend or a even good acquaintances.

236;110svkp;If it’s a spectrum, and everyone’s on it, is it still neurodivergence?;I’ve recently diagnosed myself as on the ASD and ADHD spectrum.  Thanks YouTube!  <newline>  <newline> According to a couple YouTube videos in which ASD is women is discussed, if you’re low-femme and introverted, you’re probably autistic.

240;10vz8h9;"Anyone else doesn't feel as ""functional"" as other autistics around them?";"I've always struggled with changes, it's the main thing that got me into psychiatric care when I was a child. Changes make me deeply overwhelmed, confused etc. It takes years for me to get used to certain changes and to some things I've never gotten truly used to. I feel overwhelmed even by my memories about how much my life changed over time - it feels like there are already way too many things, it feels like trying to fit a 100 gb worth of content to a phone who has only 16 or 32 gb memory. And life is a constant, unbearable change. <newline>  <newline> I can't somehow hold or focus on multiple things in my life. It's either school/work or a relationship or an interest... the complexity of an average person's life seems extremely complicated and overwhelming to me (school, work, spouse, kids, family, friends)... I've been never able to function differently than on ""one thing at a time"" basis. I'm fully consumed by one thing or activity (usually for a long time) and that's it. <newline>  <newline> I don't find most of the things that people my age enjoy fun (parties, drinking, cinema etc.). It makes me overwhelmed, slowed down, easily confused, dizzy, anxious etc. I'm the most satisfied when I'm at home in my bed. It's always been this way. Things make me tired easily. <newline>  <newline> I've always struggled with learning, understanding abstract things that ""I can't touch"" and many more things. I also tend to have strong attachment to objects and that made me struggle over the years quite a lot too. I was always told I'm too mature, but at the same time I have something inside of me that is quite naive, innocent and child-like at the same time, it's hard to explain. Now on top of it I'm physically disabled. <newline>  <newline> I think I simply wasn't made to exist in a world like this (no pity party or hard feelings please, I say it as a personal observation and it feels like there's unfortunately no other better way how to say it without sounding like I must have cried during typing this lol). And I simply wonder if someone else is in a similar position? I'm asking because I can't relate to the autistics I see on platforms like TikTok who seem to live fairly ""normal"" lives, usually talking about some little ""quirks"" or their strenghts (not trying to undermine anyone's struggles though) or most of my autistic friends (one friend is for example a medical professional that travels through the world). <newline>  <newline> (Please, don't tell me to go to therapy, I was in it for years and years and it only gave me more issues.) <newline>  <newline> I hope everyone is having a nice day. Sending lots of love to you all, I'm happy that there's a community like this, specifically for autistic women.

246;10t3rka;Childhood and Now: I think I'm Autistic...;"I think I've been missing something my entire life. I have been reading and watching videos about autism a lot lately...and I think I'm going to see a doctor soon because of it. Below I wrote down why I think I might be autistic, or somewhere in the neurodivergent club. <newline>  <newline> This whole thing is a bit of a mess, I apologize, I was writing in the order of possibly relevant memories as they came to me.  <newline>  <newline> I couldn’t make eye contact. Growing up, people were constantly trying to make me look them in the eyes, but I refused. My best friend in High School noticed I never looked anyone in the eye, and made me practice eye-contact with her for YEARS. I still prefer not to look people in the eyes, but I force myself to do it. I time it, then I look away so I’m not weirdly staring. I even think about how often I blink so I don’t make the other person uncomfortable. I’m constantly worried I’m not doing it right. I like my job, because I can talk to my clients without ever looking at their face, because I cannot look up while working on their tattoo. <newline>  <newline> I have always been extremely quiet. I didn’t like talking to anyone but my sister. I would still prefer to talk as little as possible. People always called me quiet, shy, “she never talks”, “why are you so quiet”, “you’re just ordering food, stop crying”, “it’s just a phone call, stop crying”, “it’s just a presentation, stop shaking”, “talk louder, nobody can hear you”, “you’re a good reader, reading out loud isn’t any different.” Speaking in public makes my heart beat out so hard I feel like I can’t see, I can’t breathe, I shake uncontrollably, and I get unbearably cold and shiver.  <newline>  <newline> I was at a 12th grade reading level by 3rd grade. I read EVERYTHING I could get my hands on.  <newline>  <newline> When I learned sign language freshman year in high school, I would finger spell EVERYTHING my teachers were saying, I'd hide it under my desk, or I thought I was hiding it.. I did this all through high school and college. If anyone saw me, they would ask me if I was autistic…I have been asked if I’m autistic so many times, mostly while fingerspelling, but sometimes just out of nowhere. I of course, said no, because I thought of autism as something boys had when they didn't understand how to be social. I still spell better with my hands than out loud. Since high school up to this day I often finger spell “MAN A THAT'S” over and over because the pattern is soothing.  <newline>  <newline> As a kid I rubbed smooth textures until my fingers felt raw, all the time.  <newline>  <newline> I cried if I got anything sticky on me, and I still can’t stand it. <newline>  <newline> I cried if my socks were crooked at all, and I still can’t stand it. <newline>  <newline> I could not have clothing touching my armpits, and I still can’t stand it. <newline>  <newline> The texture of velvet or corduroy makes me want to peel my own bones out. I hate it more than anything. <newline>  <newline> Turkey stuffing literally makes me gag. I have to eat yogurt slowly, or I gag. Soggy cereal? Forget it. Tres Leches cake? Absolutely not. Peas? Hell no. Soft broccoli? I’d rather die. <newline>  <newline> Would have to put my hair up to eat because I couldn’t eat with my hair touching my ears, it felt unbearable. It doesn’t happen as often in adulthood, but I still randomly freak out if my hair is touching my ears. <newline>  <newline> Lights are too bright, I'd rather have a nice orange-glow lamp at the side of the room than an overhead light.  <newline>  <newline> Some voices hit a pitch that makes me feel like my ears are bleeding, no matter the volume. Some audiobook readers make me stop listening to a book because their voice is like sharp glass on my ear drums. I had an elementary teacher with that pitch, I failed the grade because I'd plug my ears, or pretend to be leaning on my hand but plug one ear at a time, just trying to make her voice less awful. There was no way I could focus with that, add the bright school overhead lights, distracting posters, and it was a disaster. <newline>  <newline> I shut down during fights. if I get in an argument with anyone, my brain goes into ""white noise"" mode and nothing makes sense. I try to go to into a quiet area alone and just, zone out in a depressed fog...obviously that's not healthy, and I've been working really hard to end that cycle. It's also trauma related I'm sure.  <newline>  <newline> I've had extreme anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, I'd live my life with a racing heart beat and adrenaline rushes, CONSTANTLY. Everything felt like it would trigger it. I wasn't medicated until my late twenties, it's been so helpful. <newline>  <newline> I've always been bladder shy, I could NOT use a public bathroom no matter how badly it hurt. Today, I have to pretend I'm drunk at a bar to use a public bathroom, but at least I can do it now...It makes road trips a lot easier. <newline>  <newline> Kids always made fun of me for being weird, knowing too many facts, and using big words. I’m really good at trivia now, though. I would read encyclopedias for fun, and I would watch anything educational if it was on TV. NOVA was my favorite program (I'm aging myself).  <newline>  <newline> I couldn’t hold a conversation to save my life, I didn’t understand how they worked. The pattern and purpose of a conversation confused me a lot growing up, and I didn’t understand why people had conversations in the first place. I would listen to people have conversations, well into high school, trying to learn how to have a conversation properly. I still listen to conversations by other people and pick up patterns I like…this leads into mimicking. <newline>  <newline> I pick up accents, slang, and intonations from other people in my life, people on TV or in movies, to the point other people notice. When my college professors told me to get rid of my Southern Utahn accent, to sound more professional while interpreting ASL to English, it was as easy as mimicking anyone with a Northern Utahn accent and watching TV with “average” American accents. I switch back and forth easily when I hear somebody from my hometown.  <newline>  <newline> I have been day dreaming every single day for as long as I can remember. If I’m not living in an internal fantasy world, I’m being watched and judged by an imaginary audience and I act accordingly. I am never alone in my own head. I use my imagination to play stories before I can sleep. I can lucid dream and create the worlds I want to experience...I learned how to do this because I used to have nightmares every single night as a kid...and I mean literally every single night. I didn't know what it was like to sleep without nightmares until I was an adult. <newline>  <newline> I have two friends, who live out of state. I have never been able to keep friendships for longer than a few months, with the exception of those two, they have been my friends for over a decade. Even though I loved all of my friends, our friendships would just simmer out and end, and I never knew why…I just assumed they didn’t like me anymore.  <newline>  <newline> Social settings are the most exhausting thing in my life. I feel like a fraud, faking interest in small talk, making facial expressions that aren’t genuine, laughing at jokes that aren’t funny, asking questions I learned are normal things to ask. I had to practice asking other people questions about themselves. I didn’t know that was normal and polite until I was in my mid 20’s, I just assumed people would talk about themselves if they wanted to.  <newline>  <newline> I accidentally overshare all the time and analyze the conversation later and feel embarrassed for days. I know I’m awkward and I never know if I hid it well or not.  <newline>  <newline> I’m terrible about interrupting people, my brain says “this will show that you’re interested and relating” when really it’s rude and people hate it. I’m still working on that. <newline>  <newline> Special Interests? Maybe. <newline>  <newline> I taught myself how to play the piano when I was 8. I also play clarinet and saxophone, and started to teach myself how to play the cello but got too busy in college. I still want to take piano lessons as an adult, it makes me extremely sad to think about, to the point that I cry sometimes, because I miss playing piano so much.  <newline>  <newline> I hand-wrote a huge music score for a symphonic band when I was in high school, because I wanted to prove to my AP/EdNet College music professor that I didn’t need the class, I just wanted an A and to be done...I was bored out of my mind because I had been learning music since I was a little kid. I literally hand drew the measures/bars and notes for each instrument and created a unique piece. I could hear each individual instrument in my head, the notes they played, the crescendos and breaths, the whole piece. I don’t know how I realized I had the ability to do that, I just did. It just clicked. I was 16. <newline>  <newline> I loved art as a kid, and drew constantly, on every piece of paper I got my hands on, including homework. My mom is an oil painter, and I’d take her anatomy and drawing books all the time so I could learn how to draw better.  <newline>  <newline> I’m now creating art as a living, I draw every single day. I have used every medium under the sun just to try it out. It’s just as valuable to me as music. Growing up, kids would ask me to draw them things, decorate their folders, draw on their hands and arms, I even started painting and drawing on people’s jeans when that was popular. Everyone said I should be a tattoo artist, and I mean everyone: my classmates and teachers in elementary, high school, college, and my now significant other. Well, now I’m a tattoo artist, and it’s the best job I've ever had. If I could be a pianist/composer and a tattoo artist all at once, I'd be living my biggest dream.  <newline>  <newline> I draw and play music in my dreams. I will never scroll past a Reel or TikTok about art or music. These are the most important things to me, other than my family. <newline>  <newline> This is why I think there might be something up in my brain, ya know? <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Thoughts?

They may not fully grasp ableism so think they are oppressed due to some other combination of identity pieces so create conspiracy theories like ""female privilege, masculinity is not toxic, patriarchy is a lie made up by evil feminists"".  <newline>  <newline> They can end up feeling entitled, get pushy and aggressive, and are at risk of right-wing extremism (due to needing those identity pieces to end up cruising down that road. remove any one piece and you are more likely to encounter speedbumps that could slow you down to reflect).  <newline>  <newline> I suspect a lot of people on 4chan, reddit, discord, in gaming, in STEM and other historically North America allocated ""geek"" and ""nerd"" domains are on the spectrum.

253;10qs1bl;I feel invalidated, and I don't know what to think.;"Sorry, long post incoming. For TLDR just read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs. <newline>  <newline> I had an autism ""assessment"" recently (I'll explain later why it's in quotes), because I had self identified as autistic and wanted to have it confirmed. The result was they said they didn't think I was autistic. They said they recognized that I had social struggles and weren't denying that I struggled, but that they believed those struggles were due to my trauma and not autism (I was emotionally neglected and abused throughout my childhood, and I was referred to them by my trauma therapist, who summarized my trauma struggles in the referral). When I asked what made them think it couldn't be autism, they responded that I was able to make eye contact, follow conversational turn-taking, and could read emotional expressions (in the assessment they had me describe what was happening in a picture book, and apparently I did that reasonably well). In their minds, someone who can do these things can't be autistic. <newline>  <newline> I know that's bullshit. My ex, who is diagnosed autistic (diagnosed in childhood), can do all of those things (although he does struggle some with alexithymia). That's not where the bar actually is. Yes, these things are harder and unnatural or less intuitive for people with autism, but that doesn't mean they're incapable, especially if they're AFAB and highly intelligent (which I am). I did ask if they recognized masking as a possibility, and they said I wouldn't have been able to mask that well for the hour-long assessment. (\*eye roll\*) And honestly, I'm a bit thrown about the eye contact thing, because I actually avoided eye contact for most of it, especially when I was talking. But I looked at the assessor when she spoke to me, so apparently that's good eye contact? It's frustrating, because it wasn't an in-depth evaluation (which I don't think can be done in a single, one-hour session). I'm already aware that I'm ""high functioning"" and high masking, and that I ""don't look autistic."" I thought they would understand autism well enough to actually do a proper evaluation and look deeper than surface level behaviors, but it seems they didn't. <newline>  <newline> I'm already aware that trauma and autism have a huge overlap in symptoms. That's not why I thought I was autistic. If I only had the trauma symptoms and not the autism-specific traits, I wouldn't have come to that conclusion. Like most of you here, I did a deep dive into autism. I went onto the websites. Took the various inventories (on which I scored solidly in the autistic range: 36 on the AQ, 144 on the RAADS-R). I watched the youtube videos by autistic youtubers. Read and participated in the autism subreddits. And I felt like I learned something important about myself and finally found my people. I felt seen and understood in a way that reminded me of how validated I felt when I first learned about CPTSD and self-diagnosed with that. (And then afterwards, I was able to get an official CPTSD diagnosis when I sought it out, because my self-assessment was accurate.) <newline>  <newline> I related to others in the autistic community in the ways I normally felt different from other people. In particular, the way I think and communicate was really highlighted as being an autistic way of thinking and using language. I'm very literal and I mean exactly what I say, and I tend to assume others do to (and I get frustrated when they, for example, answer a question I didn't ask while not answering the question that I did ask, as if I were asking a different question than the one I articulated). Everything is face value with me. I'm genuine, honest, and direct, and I don't understand social hierarchy (except to some degree where it's formalized, like in employment settings). Getting insight into that from *Autism from the Inside* was generally helpful for understanding why people perceived me in ways that didn't correspond at all to how I actually was (eg. being seen as snobby and stuck-up or hostile). I've learned a lot from his videos, things that I, at 35 years old, still hadn't picked up on, despite having a special interest in psychology and emotional intelligence. <newline>  <newline> I identify with autism because I have significant autistic traits, and I genuinely believe my brain is wired in an autistic way. That said, I recognize that I do have *some* capacities that are less common or less well developed among other autistic people, and that in some ways I am not as ""extreme"" in a trait as a typical autistic person. <newline>  <newline> For example, I do have sensory sensitivities (clothing *must* be comfortable above all else), and I'm a bit of a picky eater, who cares about food texture and eats their food in a particular order. However, I don't have those issues to such a degree that other people notice or complain, or to the degree that it negatively affects my life. I don't have a highly restricted diet, I can usually find something on a menu that I'm willing to eat, etc. So I'm ""quirky,"" but it's not disabling. My sensory sensitivities only really cause me problems when they are also triggers, which they often are. So I acknowledge that that's more of an issue with trauma than autism. <newline>  <newline> I am also better at picking up on social cues than other autistic people (even though I still struggle with it more than a neurotypical person). My mom, who was never diagnosed, but was *undeniably autistic* (utterly incapable of masking), could not read social cues for the life of her. And I do mean that literally. My dad was abusive to her, and she could not protect herself by recognizing when she was pushing his buttons and then backing off. She used to tell me how she felt like his abuse came at random, and it was entirely unpredictable. When I was a child, her comment genuinely confused me, because I could pick up on my dad's cues, and his violence wasn't random. His tone changed when he was getting angry, and I knew to back off when I started pushing his buttons. So I was much better than my mom was at avoiding his abuse (at least, the physical abuse). <newline>  <newline> Only when I realized my mom was autistic did her comment make sense (also a lot more of her behavior made sense once I realized she was autistic, like her *utter inability* to manage turn-taking in conversation, extreme special interests that she talked about to no end without realizing no one else was interested, and a massive impairment in executive functioning to the point she lost jobs because she literally could not get anywhere on time to save her life and routinely was *hours* late to events and appointments). Honestly, the main reason I didn't think I was autistic initially when it first came to my attention was because I compared myself to my mom, and I never struggled on anywhere near the level that she did. But if I compare myself to a neurotypical person, it's clear I'm not ""normal."" I've felt like a weirdo/freak my whole life. And I'm sure some of that is the trauma. But some of it is the autism too. <newline>  <newline> I also don't have alexithymia. I do have delayed emotional processing, though, and difficulties with interoception. Like, if you ask me how I feel about something, I may give an immediate answer, but then come back a day later after I've had time to think about it, and then I will have a much more developed and accurate answer (that might be quite different than the initial answer I gave). <newline>  <newline> For these reasons, I do have some doubts as to whether I truly meet the threshold for diagnosis, which is part of why I wanted to be assessed. I could very well be subclinical rather than level 1. With the disability model that we currently have, it's like, you're not autistic unless you ""suffer"" from autism, unless you have it to such a degree that it is inherently disabling--and more specifically, not unless it's bothering the people around you. And in my case, I *am* disabled, but I think I am disabled because of my trauma, and the intersection of my autism and trauma. Without the trauma, I'd still have autistic traits, but I'd probably be able to manage well enough despite them that it wouldn't cause me significant issues. I'd probably naturally self-accommodate, and in that way be relatively functional. But my CPTSD is incredibly disabling for me, and the autistic traits contribute to those challenges. <newline>  <newline> And one thing in particular, is that when I get triggered to a child part, I feel ""more autistic."" Basically, I think my autistic traits were more pronounced in childhood (and I had less social awareness and understanding to be able to consciously compensate for them), and so when I am triggered to a child part, it's like I become more disabled. I am less able to understand emotions, social complexities, less able to tolerate distressing emotions or manage them, extremely prone to situational mutism and meltdown/shutdown. (More often I go straight to shutdown, though, because growing up, I learned it wasn't safe to have meltdowns, given how abusively my dad reacted when my mom or my little sister had meltdowns.) <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I asked my ex for his opinion, since he knows me quite well and he is diagnosed autistic and has been through the full evaluation process. He told me that the ""assessment"" I had was not a thorough evaluation, that it was more likely a basic screening that was only looking for moderate to severe ASD. Because I did this through the public health system, they're not looking to pick up on mild cases, as they don't consider it a worthwhile use of resources. If I wanted a proper evaluation, I'd probably have to go private. I'm entitled to appeal this decision and seek a second opinion, but it's probably not worth it just to, at best, detect that I am mildly autistic. He said it wouldn't entitle me to any better access to resources or treatment than my CPTSD diagnosis already does. He also pointed out that if I hadn't had the trauma, I probably wouldn't have felt the need to seek formal diagnosis for autism, and he's probably right about that. <newline>  <newline> I guess the main reason I'm posting here (and sorry this was so excessively long and rambly a post), is to ask if I'm still welcome in the community, despite having been deemed ""not autistic"" from a supposedly professional assessment. (Honestly, was quite surprised how not-thorough their assessment was, given that this was an autism center, supposedly one of the most competent, and specifically had a department for adults on the spectrum.) It's not like I'm going around making myself a spokesperson for autism or trying to get accommodations I don't need and shouldn't be entitled to. I just feel like I found a community of like-minded people, and it's nice. I want to still be a part of that, regardless of whether I am formally diagnosed.";PertinaciousFox;False;31;0.86;2023-02-01 11:45:18;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10qs1bl/i_feel_invalidated_and_i_dont_know_what_to_think/;autisminwomen

257;10ph7jb;Nonprofit Shoutout for Autistic Adults: nonPareil Institute Online;  <newline>  <newline> Hello, my name is Sam and I am autistic and am an instructor to other autistic adults in a nonprofit called nonPareil Institute Online. <newline>  <newline> A year ago, I was invited to a podcast called “The FeelGood Podcast” where they highlighted my interest in making special education materials. That podcast funny enough got seen by my future boss after my interview! <newline>  <newline> It’s already been over six months as an instructor. It really is a dream come true for me. <newline>  <newline> It’s not a magical place where everything is always perfect, but it has the thing I’ve always wanted, being treated like I’m apart of a team. <newline>  <newline> Our crewmembers aren’t traditional students, they are adults with their own unique backgrounds that brought them to our program. It’s a secondary institution and our focus is teaching them the professional skills they need to succeed by help them develop a portfolio, art and design tech skills, that will hopefully support them as they move forward in college or their chosen careers. <newline>  <newline> From clubs to their classes, we support all of them to learn self-advocacy and to help us help them. It’s more than just “job readiness”, it’s building a community. <newline>  <newline> But it doesn’t end with our crew, the instructors walk the walk outside the classroom. <newline>  <newline> NonPareil actively tries to hire autistic adults as instructors. Never before have I worked in an environment that actively enjoys my special interest! <newline>  <newline> I believe our culture is something to be envied and I truly hope it continues to grow. <newline>  <newline> I know we have a hard time finding trustworthy nonprofits in our community, so I very much wanted to share my interview in hopes that others can be encouraged and maybe even join in. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> [The FillGood Podcast: nonPareil Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM0mhhfgQLw&ab_channel=TheFillGoodPodcast) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Feel free to ask me questions in the comments, I whole heartily believe if we support nonprofits that include us in their structure, we can grow stronger as a community.;Lilsammywinchester13;False;0;1.0;2023-01-30 23:11:00;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10ph7jb/nonprofit_shoutout_for_autistic_adults_nonpareil/;autisminwomen

You shouldn't add them on Facebook or email to follow up.  <newline>  <newline> If a former good friend suddenly only wants to meet within a group setting, that relationship is over.  <newline>  <newline> If someone, especially a potential date, ASKS for you to confirm the meeting the day of, don't count on it and make other plans. <newline>  <newline> ONE electronic non reply (Social Media, Text, IM) where you know it delivered is a rejection. Don't keep following up to make sure.  <newline>  <newline> If a former colleague or acquaintance reaches out of a blue sky, they want something either implicit (ego boost, laughs) or explicit (job referral, expertise, hookup, gossip).  <newline>  <newline> People make relationships largely out of what they get out of it in some form, not how good natured/earnest a person is. <newline>  <newline> Once a friendship goes sour, you are better off severing that cord than dragging it out. <newline>  <newline> Edit:  <newline>  <newline> If that friend only meets up when all the stars align for them (winter, coffee shop around the corner, Wednesday night) they just aren't that into you. <newline>  <newline> If someone cancels or reject a meetup offer and doesn't counterproposal for a better time, it's OVA! <newline>  <newline> ""Nice guys"" will often use a hook to make their physical advances like a new anime series, videogames, pet, marijuana, comic book movie. <newline>  <newline> If you aren't sure about sending that social media/LinkedIn connection request to a person, trust your gut and pass. <newline>  <newline> If that friend always cancels with you due to a sick child, flu, car troubles but you see on social media that they are still going out , Hasta La Vista Baby! <newline>  <newline> Summary: I think a lot of you would benefit from reading Doc Love.

What hobbies. I used to play video games but that only works when I’m hype fixated on them. If I don’t have that need to play, I will just vegetate on YouTube for hours and eat food. I don’t even draw anymore, at least not substantial. I get four sketch lines in and immediately hate what I’m doing and put it down. <newline>  <newline> I feel like I’m just floating through life without ever landing on anything solid. Everything I like, my favorite games, my clothes, my music taste, hobbies, have been either influenced by or directly taken from the people around me. My friends listen to one band sand it’s their favorite, so I listened to it and now it’s my favorite too. Same thing with the things they like: hiking, mushrooms, cottage core stuff, everything. I assimilate it. They mentioned it to me the other day that it seemed like whatever they like, I end up liking too. It made me feel sick, like everything I e ever done has just been a copy.  <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what I’m supposed to be. I don’t feel like anything but a weird faceless blob moving through life as a shapeshifter. I want to feel like I have my own face. I just sort of exist as blandly as possible with my body and suck the personality away from others and make it my own.  <newline>  <newline> Anyone know how to fix it?

265;10l70e0;I need frienship advice (or just need your thoughts on it);"I'm not sure on wich subreddit to post this on, so I decided to do this one. <newline>  <newline> but my friend (that I used to consider my bestfriend) only really talks to me when she needs tickets for a concert, because I got her tickets last time (she pays them back of course) simply because she is to busy with work, and I currently don't have a job.  <newline>  <newline> she asked today, if I could arrange tickets for her again.

(more context: those friends tried to get tickets also for the same concert, so that is why, but it still feels wrong) <newline>  <newline> I know she still cares about me, and still wants the best for me, as I still want the same for her. but it just seems like she doesn't want to hang out with me anymore (maybe only because she feels obligted to)  and today she litterly asked me te arrange tickets for her again, while litterly not saying anything for weeks, unless it came like from my side. <newline>  <newline> like litterly everything could be just my black and white thinking, but still, I feel used. <newline>  <newline> and I don't know what to do, I mean I could question our friendship about it, but I don't want to be like ""you're a bad friend, you only really talk to me when you need something, and you know it cuz you appoligize for it, but then you end up in the same freaking cycle""  <newline>  <newline> again, she probably isn't really that of a bad friend, it is probably my black and white thinking cuz yesterday (after a while) I told her about this thing that I signed up for (wich I wanted to do since I was a child) and she was rooting me for it. but also, any human being could have rooted me for it (my family memebers did) so like, although I'm gratefull, she rooted, again, it could have been a litteral stranger rooting for me.";nobodythemadder;False;5;1.0;2023-01-25 19:18:34;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10l70e0/i_need_frienship_advice_or_just_need_your/;autisminwomen

267;10j8s7v;My whole day got thrown off because my husband changed his routine.;Long vent, sorry and thank you in advance. You don't need to read it, I just need to get it out.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I work part time, my husband full time. <newline>  <newline> On Mondays (my day off) my husband gets up with the kids and makes their lunches so I can sleep in a tiny bit, because otherwise I'm the one up early every single day.  <newline>  <newline> He leaves with the kids at 7:30, I usually sleep until 8 and then start my day. But at 8, I hear the front door open and my husband comes on the room, just as I'm waking up. He said he's not feeling well, doesn't want to go to work, and comes into bed with me. I start to get anxious because he wants to cuddle in bed with me and I'm feeling stressed because I wanted to throw the curtains open, get cleaned up and dressed and start getting shit done around the house, before catching my train  into the city to go to the Asian market.  <newline>  <newline> Honestly,  him just coming home already threw me off. And then he tells me he feels sad because I don't want to cuddle with him.  <newline>  <newline> If he just asked me to stay for five minutes and then let me go, I would have been able to cope with the big change to my routine. But he starts telling me about how sad and disappointed he is that I want to get out of bed.  <newline>  <newline> I felt sick and overwhelmed from my plans being changed and got upset and told him this is completely breaking down all the motivation and energy I had planned for the day. And now I feel upset because you're upset at me for not wanting to stay in bed, when I already had plans for how my day would go.  <newline>  <newline> I stayed in bed stiffly for about 20 minutes and he fell asleep and was snoring and then I snuck out, fumbling in the dark for some clothes, and had to do my hair in my daughter's room with her stuff because I couldn't put the light on in our room. I went to the kitchen, and of course there's no milk for my decaf coffee, the dogs were not fed or let out on time and one peed on the floor.  <newline>  <newline> I have been stuck sitting on the couch watching tiktoks for 2 hours now instead of getting anything done that I wanted and needed to today.  <newline>  <newline> I didn't get the laundry going, haven't gone to the grocery store, missed the train I needed to catch 40 minutes ago. He's still up in bed sleeping, and I can't get my clothes and things now without waking him up.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> He's going to think I'm emotional and lazy or something stupid, and say it's my own fault or something.  <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to have a nice productive Monday and get the house in order for the week and make sure we have groceries (I do all the shopping and cooking). And nowy day is ruined and no one will understand why I can't just do what I planned now. It's ruined.

268;10fhkxq;I am so angry at the system we live within.;I try to justify certain things but I don’t know how much longer I can. I am so angry with the system we live in, how they treat people with disabilities. How most people who are there to “help us” don’t even truly understand us. They have an education but they don’t have the lived experience. How true help is so few and far between. How to get certain access you need to spend money you don’t have and even then it is a gamble of if real help is on the other side of your money. How these people with education, masters or doctorate degrees think they better than you, above you. Can treat you less than, can take advantage of you. Like they think we are stupid and don’t know. <newline>  <newline> I hate that because they do hold the power they can get away with it. I am angry.  <newline>  <newline> I just went through a situation with a psychologist and after discussing it with family and friends and my therapists I can say I have been medical gaslight and down $2000 in the process.  I have been made to feel like an annoyance when I have been patient, understanding, calm, and let someone continue to give me the run away for 6 months of my life with bare minimum results when I was told I would have something completely different come out of all of this. I want to say I am shocked, but I am not. I have been going through the system since I was 13. Begging for help, advocating for myself. This is just the first time I spent money in hopes to get the help. I am falling deeper into bitterness, anger, isolation, depression. <newline>  <newline> Even though i have never felt a moment of ease since as young as I can remember, I never remember feeling as much pessimism and anger as I have the last few years and its starting to boil over. How can we live in such a flawed system when so much knowledge has come to light. I see these groups, tik toks, instagrams with so much knowledge and its like the people who are there and are supposed to be HELPING, SUPPORTING, making life a bit easier are the ones with no knowledge at all.  <newline>  <newline> I am sick of having to educate and advocate for myself over, and over, and over and over. <newline> It is exhausting having to sit and divulge such vulnerable parts of me hoping to get help only to get a metaphorical slap in the face.;Blacksmith_Actual;False;11;0.92;2023-01-18 20:20:48;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10fhkxq/i_am_so_angry_at_the_system_we_live_within/;autisminwomen

270;10dsbya;DAE feel like the main autism sub is becoming increasingly more hostile towards women and fem people, especially self dx people?;It's literally just misogyny, ESPECIALLY if someone's alt or otherwise doesn't conform to traditional female gender norms. I feel like this is one of the only subs where I can draw these parallels and not get called a faker for even suggesting that misogyny could be influencing their opinions on self diagnosis. Or suggesting that the way professionals go about diagnosing women and afab people is misogynistic and outdated. I see this happening a lot when people talk about autistic people on TikTok. The main people being fakeclaimed are women, teenage girls and generally anyone perceived as female or fem. Claiming they're 'spreading misinformation' for talking about symptoms or even just making harmless jokes about being autistic. Once I read a comment that said that people on TikTok were giving the community a bad name for 'infantilizing themselves' and 'dressing like a child'. <newline>  <newline>  Because apparently dressing a certain way means you're trying to infantilize yourself. /s <newline>  <newline> They really like to put people into boxes so they can easily dismiss them. They also like to dismiss women's symptoms by saying, 'everyone does that, your making human things into autism things', while completely ignoring any other symptoms and how much they might be suffering. Similar to the term 'female hysteria', which was used to basically say 'its all in your head' when women were experiencing any kind of problem. Even doctors today still downplay women's symptoms and say it's all in their head or that they're making it up for attention. Medical misogyny is still very much alive and well. They're even called attention 'whores'. A word specifically used to degrade, slut shame, and belittle women and fem presenting people and their problems.  <newline>  <newline> Personally I think the only reason we have such an 'epidemic' of 'fakers' is because people are just labeling anyone they don't like as a fake, and for some reason people believe it without question. Most fakeclaimers have no proof for their accusations and they're just going off appearance. And an overwhelming majority of people getting fake claimed are women and fem presenting people, especially if they're alt or don't adhere to traditional gender roles in some way. They're getting fake claimed because of the sexist idea that women do everything for attention.;verylongeyebags;False;54;0.88;2023-01-16 21:17:06;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10dsbya/dae_feel_like_the_main_autism_sub_is_becoming/;autisminwomen

272;10d25oy;What are some unwritten social rules that you had to learn to be perceived as professional?;"I (27F) am newly diagnosed. I just graduated from college and got my first professional job. I haven't had my first day yet. I signed a contract for 1 year, and I want to stay for a long time, so I need to not have a weird relationship with my coworkers (I tend to have weird relationships with a lot of bosses, coworkers and classmates because I don't understand nuerotypical people or how to talk to them.) <newline>  <newline> I don't think I can tell my coworkers that I'm autistic. Apparently, you're not supposed to tell people about your health issues at work. I think if I tell them, it will seem awkward, random, and weird. Most people can't tell that I'm autistic. Some people don't believe me. Also, I don't want my coworkers to think I am seeking attention or maybe that I watch too much tiktok or something (apparently autism is ""trendy"" at the moment 🙄.) <newline>  <newline> Since people can't tell that I have autism and I can't tell them, they usually think I fluctuate between being very friendly and very rude. Sometimes, they think I'm obsessed with myself. Sometimes, they think I'm odd or mean or too nice. All because I memorized some unwritten social rules and not others. <newline>  <newline> I'm trying to research what the social rules are at work, but most resources are for nonautistic people who want to talk to autistic people. That helps in some ways, but I need advice that is FOR ME. That is why I am here. Even youtube channels made by autistic people are all about helping non-autistic people understand autistic people.  <newline>  <newline> Please give me examples of unwritten social rules that you had to learn to seem professional.  <newline>  <newline> I'll give you examples of things I learned while researching, so you know what kind of thing I'm talking about: <newline>  <newline>    In your first conversation with a new person, you are supposed to ask about their hobbies, where they are from, and what their name is. <newline>  <newline>    Don't talk about your special interest for more than 1 or 2 sentences. <newline>  <newline>    If someone asks you a question about yourself, you are supposed to give a short answer and then ask them the same question.  <newline>  <newline>   If someone shares something about themselves/their weekend/something they like to do for fun/something that happened to them/something they dislike etc., you are not supposed to say ""that happened to me too"" or ""I went to that musicians concert too"" and then share your experience because neurotypical people will think you are trying to steal attention from them. (Even though you are just trying to relate to them and show empathy.) <newline>  <newline>    You are not supposed to give more than 1 or 2 compliments in the same conversation. <newline>  <newline>    Never rant. <newline>  <newline>   Avoid talking about yourself/your life/your family unless someone asks. <newline>  <newline>   Don't tell people you are good at something because they will think you are bragging/narcissistic.  <newline>  <newline>   Don't correct people. <newline>  <newline>   Don't talk about anything sad or serious. <newline>  <newline>   Don't share anything personal or ask personal questions.

273;10cuyv0;Feeling Misunderstood and Melting down from comments on facebook post;My mother in law is coming to stay with us this next week to help out while my partner is on a work trip. I posted about some issues I’ve had with her in a facebook moms group that I’m a part of and the comments that came in left me feeling like I’m completely unreasonable and I feel so misunderstood. My anxiety is so high and I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.  <newline>  <newline> Here’s my post :  <newline>  <newline> This is going to be a little ranty so please bear with me.  <newline>  <newline> I have an emotionally manipulative MIL. I didn’t really notice to what degree until our kids started to get older and I started trying to set some boundaries with her. Every time I’ve set any kind of boundary or confronted her about anything she’s responded very negatively. She seems to crave control and does not communicate effectively. She has a really passive aggressive way of showing she’s upset to the point where i’ve gotten completely ignored on more than one occasion. I thought i was imagining it for a while but I’ve noticed a pattern.  <newline>  <newline> Recently I set a boundary with her asking that she communicate with me and my partner before she purchases gifts for our kids. Seems simple enough. I’m not asking that she refrain from giving our kids gifts, just that we talk first. She reacted very strongly when I set this boundary and it’s turned into a whole thing where she’s found ways to skirt the boundary any way she can.  <newline>  <newline> We also have a boundary that people need to ask before giving physical affection to our kids. while we were visiting my in-laws over the holidays my MIL was touching by son’s hair without asking and at first i had a fawn response and then spoke up and just kindly said “Just a reminder that we ask before we touch.” She quickly said “sorry” but then avoided me pretty much the rest of the time we were visiting and instead of talking to me about the boundary surrounding physical affection she waited until I wasn’t  around and talked to my partner about it.  <newline> She also at times when we’re visiting asks my partner questions about the kids while I’m in the room as if I’m not even there (for example — “do you want them to have dessert or not?” or “what are your plans for tomorrow with the kids?”). It all feels very calculated in an effort to undermine me or send some kind of message that she’s uncomfortable with my boundaries. My partner and I are on the same page about boundaries but I am usually the one speaking up about them unless I specifically ask that he engage.  <newline> I grew up with a parent who behaved similarly to my MIL — but i was a kid and didn’t feel like I had the power to set my own boundaries yet. Since growing up and learning about toxic behavior I’ve learned how to navigate communication with people who aren’t very emotionally intelligent and have actually cut off contact with the parent I grew up with who was so emotionally manipulative. But now I feel like I’m dealing with the same bullshit all over again with my MIL and almost feel crazy trying to describe the behaviors I’m seeing to my partner. He is beginning to understand I think, but still hasn’t encountered the things I have.  <newline>  <newline> My MIL is coming to visit and help us out this coming week while my partner is on a trip and my anxiety levels are incredibly high. I struggle to have genuine positive interactions with her because I know how she acts when she feels like she isn’t getting what she wants and I really don’t want to deal with the stress of her passive aggressive communication style. <newline>  <newline> Does anyone have a family member who is like this? Did you feel crazy trying to describe the behavior patterns you saw to other people? It’s so frustrating 😣 <newline>  <newline>     <newline> Someone commented asking about my reasoning behind the gift giving boundary and I shared that random gift giving without parental approval can be a grooming tactic so this all ties into the way we are trying to teach consent to our kids.  <newline>  <newline> commenter’s response: <newline>  <newline> Group member oh yes that [grooming] is certainly a concern. Perhaps it’s worth seeing that she sees herself as as much family to your children as you see yourself though. So, she can’t imagine why you would be the safe person to run a gift by. Honestly obviously anyone in a family can be a groomer or abuser, even the parents, we only can truly know that one person, ourself, isn’t doing that. So, from her perspective you are no more a safe person to choose boundaries and protect the kids than she is. She can’t see your heart. I have to admit I’m not seeing how a parent controlling a gift teaches a kid consent? That’s just someone else controlling the situation, not empowering a child to control their own. Again though really not at all asking you to justify your parenting choices to me, as I am a random asshole on the internet. I am just thinking through what is causing MIL to resist these boundaries so stringently and she might, maybe, just be a person that really needs to understand the whys to not feel like she’s just being controlled.” <newline>  <newline> and then another commenter:  <newline>  <newline> “I agree with the comment above. You csnt really choose someone else's love language. You could be killing her ability to feel like she is showing love to them. If she has to ask to play with his hair? He should be able to say, grandma stop i dont like that. They need a voice to speak up. Also if you told me I needed yo ask permission to give gifts and its bc of grooming... Like wow. Accusing grandma of such a thing... No wonder she ignores you and speaks around you to your husband. Not everyone giving you a gift is trying to get into your pants.... They need to know that too. Just sounds like there is a lot of boundaries and no freedom to love and clearly NO trust. You don't trust this lady and she sees it. Not everyone is trying to hurt your kids 😅 if someone acted like i was a pedo i wouldn't like them either.... Teach children what's okay and not okay with physical touch. Keep an eye on your kid. You can see grooming... And you can see a grandparent givinf a gift. <newline> My parents literally give my kids a gift every single time we see them. They gave 100000 toys at grandmas. They arent grooming them... They are spoiling them 🙃 but to each their own. But i get where your MIL is coming from. Your really using pushing the boundaries IMO.” <newline>  <newline>  <newline> TLDR: I tried venting in a facebook group and the comments overwhelmingly left me feeling misunderstood and now I’m spiraling.;SnooPeppers8677;False;5;0.75;2023-01-15 21:06:39;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10cuyv0/feeling_misunderstood_and_melting_down_from/;autisminwomen

277;10c99xr;Validation and Non-bianary identity;" TLDR I don't necessarily understand humans and human relationships/social needs. Is needing validation from others actually a need or is it a want that isn't necessary?  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> So recently I came to the realization that I am Non-bianary. And there are all sorts of internal complications with this. I have read some articles, seen some youtube videos etc and educated myself on what the term means and how and why I fit into it. And I think that generally is a good place to start.  <newline>  <newline> What gets more complicated is going out into the world and interacting with people and getting a wide variety of thoughts, opinions and theories on this subject. Some of them are welcoming, some are horrible and some of it is a mixed bag, including criticism.  <newline>  <newline> I don't think I need everyone to call me by my preferred pronouns and I don't think everyone needs to know about this aspect of me that I identify as. But the issue that I have run into is the desire for external validation on something that ultimately is not up to others and is not about them. And in some ways there is strength in just owning who you are. But considering how somewhat new this revelation is for me, and how fragile I already kind of feel about it, I am not sure if validation from others is necessarily what I need but in some ways it's what I want.  <newline>  <newline> But then I think about how we are very social animals and on an evolutionary level, rejection from ""the group"" in early human could result in a life or death situation. So I am left wondering, is social validation actually a need? Is the lack of it a part of why my mental distress is so high? <newline>  <newline> When you look at the hierarchy of needs, social security is part of that. And the complication of all of this is that as humans we have done something unprecedented. We now can have relationships with anyone anywhere in the world without actually ever meeting. So there is this added social construct that, from an evolutionary perspective, is simply not accounted for in our mental and social wellbeing. Obviously I know reddit is not really a good place to have an ""in group"" and social rejection on the internet is trivial and ultimately unimportant. I can think of that logically and distance myself intellectually but emotionally I cannot - at least at this point in time - and I find myself in severe mental distress over a topic that I desire validation over and instead see extreme hatred or, at best criticism on.  <newline>  <newline> But to add to that, my ""in group"" is influenced by the social presence and phenomenon that is the internet. So, although people in my life have done their best to be supportive, the same criticisms in conversations have arisen. Specifically in reference to the use of my chosen pronouns she/they. The mix confuses people and intentional or not, I hear people using she and never using they. Instead of asking me questions, they lean on old habits. Yet awkward situations come up where people struggle to come up with a gender neutral term, or I can see them clearly internally freaking out because they slipped up and used my legal name instead of my chosen name. So in some sense they are trying but in other ways I feel like they aren't.  And in many ways I feel like there is this eggshell situation where the fear of an accusation of transphia or hate speech stops people from having a productive conversation but instead become avoidant.  <newline>  <newline> Additionally there is the added complication of complex feelings. I don't think its inherently something I have to explain but its something I want to explore and talk about but feel like it's not valid feelings to have. In particular I feel like I am a woman and Non-bianary. And sometimes I want to express as a woman, I feel I belong in the ""womans club"" for a variety of reasons and it is an important part of my identity. But the other aspect is that I have a lot of feelings that don't align with being a woman. Part of it is gender roles and expectations but there has always been this ""otherness"" about me. Things that other girls, other women have enjoyed, I do not. Thought patterns, views on the world, behaviors, mannerisms etc. In many ways I am more well defined as outside the bianary and/or more masculine. So more nuanced description/identity of me would be gender fluid or demi-girl. Yet I feel the default assumption is that I lack a gender at all.  <newline>  <newline> And logically I know this is valid, that there are words and definitions explaining these exact feelings and phenomenon. But what I am struggling with is the big difference between reading an article or a watching a YouTube Channel about this, and interacting with the world about this. And in a lot of ways it has left me feeling alone and isolated and feeling empty and alien. And I feel I am extra sensitive to the criticisms out there not to mention the outright hatred.  <newline>  <newline> What feels most unfulfilling to me is that I haven't had the opportunity to talk about and reflect on these feelings without the criticisms. That I haven't had much of the validation beyond ""I support you"". And maybe the big issue here is that I'm not talking to people who feel similarly to me. Maybe the issue is I am talking to people who are essentially on the outside. But I am not sure. It's been a real struggle and although I feel that going a large portion of my life feeling like an ""other"" and not necessarily having the words or understanding to express that has been painful and isolating in its own right... i do feel like the change over to ""I identify as this"" and coming out to the world like that has caused a special kind of rawness to myself and my mental state. It's causing all sorts of feelings of imposter syndrome and feeling like a fraud and feeling like I am invisible and not valid etc etc that has honestly caused a pretty big mental spiral since I came out about it.  <newline>  <newline> I just don't know what to do with it all. Maybe I just need time but I feel that validation is necessary and that I'm not getting that? And then I feel guilty for needing that from other humans.";DeadlyRBF;False;4;0.67;2023-01-15 03:26:19;/r/AutismInWomen/comments/10c99xr/validation_and_nonbianary_identity/;autisminwomen

Everyone is so young but quite nice and I’m always tempted to tell them ‘nothing you do actually matters’.

If I ask him to, he straight up refuses and tells me to do it, as I have better fine motor skills, and I like crafts, so why should he do it? <newline>  <newline> But the kid likes doing crafts. Kindergarden does it, so he wants to do it at home.  <newline>  <newline> I hate to let him get away with it, I don't want to disappoint my kid. It's not a thing I want to risk a major fight on.

287;vbeqvn;Vacation problems;"Hey folks. I just got back from a vacation my spouse planned. We stayed at a hotel. It was nice but also sucked? For background I usually plan our vacations and they are always to the Catskills because my family has a trailer up there.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> My mother pays the bills so all we have to pay for is gas, food, tolls (350 space bucks. Name the movie that's from and win a prize. You can't tell I have AuDHD can you? )  <newline>  <newline> Anyways so he wants to go to the Poconos. We stayed at a ritzy place, the Hampton Inn, and it was not horrible but not great? I only got diagnosed a few months ago so I'm still trying to figure my shit out, to use a modern colloquialism. I'm trying to unmask and recognize when I still want and when I'm even doing it.  <newline>  <newline> So this hotel was kinda overwhelming because I wake up early and everyone else slept in, even my ND kid who is Mr. 5:30AM. Luckily I found a really nice nature spot to sit in and stim looking at clouds and listening to my headphones. I also hit the pool every day. <newline>  <newline> But also, my old man took us places and wanted to surprise us and didn't say exactly where. So I didn't bring my inhaler to any of the hikes. The last hike, is he last day, I had an Asthma attack luckily it wasn't so far from the car so he could easily reach it and me.  <newline>  <newline> I also tweaked my ankle and have a bum SI joint so I need to wear braces when I exercise. I don't know if he told me and I forgot (50 percent chance, maybe higher) or he didn't tell me (possible). What's most likely is I he told me and I didn't understand what he meant because he didn't specifically say, ""We are going on a hike today. Bring all the things you need like your inhaler.""  <newline>  <newline> Food was cheap but okay and when I didn't want to do stuff and sit in the car and knit he was cool about it. Whereas previous to my diagnosis he would have been annoying about it.  <newline>  <newline> So in conclusion I recommend that you learn from my experience and watch this YouTube from Purple Ella for more travel and vacation tips.

293;1227r4r;"Any of you curious about ""The Power""?";"I'm one of those types who tends to prefer the relatively *plausible* where my fiction is concerned.  I've never liked fantasy, scifi, or horror - and I usually have a lot of difficulty with magical realism. <newline>  <newline> However, about a year or two ago I read Naomi Alderman's *The Power*, and really enjoyed it.  Mind you, I considered that book less typical magical realism, and more along the lines of Margaret Atwood's ""speculative fiction"" or counterfactual history - even if you couldn't envision the story actually *happening*, I found the social criticism inherent in the thought experiment of the story's conceit really fascinating. <newline>  <newline> In case you haven't heard about or read it, here's a succinct *précis* of the plot, courtesy of Wikipedia: <newline>  <newline> >***The Power*** is a 2016 science fiction novel by the British writer Naomi Alderman.  Its central premise is women developing the ability to release electrical jolts from their fingers, thus leading them to become the dominant sex. <newline>  <newline> It's been made into a TV series that will air (here in the US anyway) at the end of next week.  The [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjcgp-FxMxk) I saw for it makes it look like some insipid teen drama - but I'm hoping against hope that the show will do the story justice. <newline>  <newline> I'll probably watch it - at least the first episode or two - because even from the trailer I recognise a lot of the locations from when I lived in Vancouver, and I expect that I'll get caught up in the production-level ""mechanics"" of it all.  But if I don't get the same ""feel"" from it that I did from the book, I'll likely chuck it. <newline>  <newline> Is anyone here a Naomi Alderman fan, or curious to take in this programme?

295;11aj9hr;On the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine;"Back in August, during what was probably the darkest period of the Ukraine war to date, I was watching a special BBC Proms concert of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra from 31 July - and I experienced some interesting “flashbacks” to the days when I was a professional classical musician in the late 80s-early 90s. <newline>  <newline> I was initially reminded of a concert I did with the San Francisco Symphony in January 1990.  I had arrived home the day before rehearsals from a holiday trip to my then-husband’s family in Dublin, during which world events following the fall of the Berlin Wall were still evolving (on the trip over to Europe, I arrived at Heathrow to find news of the death of Ceauşescu on the TV screens).   <newline>  <newline> Our programme’s main offering was Prokofiev’s *Alexander Nevsky*, the soundtrack to the Soviet-era Eisenstein film that became a mainstay of Stalinist propaganda. The conductor was the then-East German *maestro* Kurt Masur - who only a few months previous to this gig had taken to the airwaves during anti-government demonstrations in Leipzig to help keep the peace in the weeks before the Wall fell.    <newline>  <newline> I remember remarking to some of my colleagues that it was ironic to be an American orchestra doing a concert of Stalinist music in a post-Soviet era, led by an East German conductor - I joked that all we needed was a Chinese soloist to sing the mezzo-soprano part, and we’d complete the Cold War bingo card.  <newline>  <newline> Some months later, Ukraine declared independence, and became a sovereign nation the following year.  In 1994, Ukraine, Russia, the UK and the US signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to decommission all nuclear weapons within its borders in return for the respect of its territorial integrity and an assurance of assistance in the event of attack from another party.  <newline>  <newline> Now, here I was, watching an orchestra from a country at war to maintain its independence and national sovereignty performing, amongst other pieces, Chopin’s transcendent second Piano Concerto, played by the Ukrainian pianist Anna Fedorova.  <newline>  <newline> YouTube has taken down all the clips from this concert, but here’s a much older performance by this pianist of the sublime [second movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GMwKYRgwM). <newline>  <newline> As I sat there with tears streaming down my face, something about seeing the blue and yellow ribbons on the lapels of the orchestra personnel - and on many members of the audience - took me back to the ""charnel house"" days in San Francisco when, bearing the symbolic red ribbon, I had performed in and attended countless AIDS benefits and the funerals of friends and colleagues.  That was also a time during which we felt besieged by too much death and despair, and when playing music seemed to be the only thing that pushed back the darkness - if just for a little while.  <newline>  <newline> Earlier that day, I had read an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/12/scientist-taken-own-life-health-workers-covid) in the Guardian about the suicide of Lisa-Maria Kellermayr, an Austrian physician and public health advocate who had suffered months of death threats and abuse from COVID conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers.  She was just one of countless medical professionals who have found themselves in the cross-hairs of the ignorant for merely trying to help people.  <newline>  <newline> At the time, in an admittedly heightened emotional state, I remember feeling somewhat embittered about how the losses in war are valorised - whereas, in a public health emergency, those who die are sometimes doubly victimised by a population that wishes to find any way possible to blame the dead for their demise (so that they, themselves, can feel less vulnerable).  <newline>  <newline> Similarly, those who deal violent death, even in the course of defending themselves from unwarranted attack, are celebrated - but those who, sometimes at a cost of their own lives, sacrifice themselves to treat those who are suffering, to conduct research to find a cure when possible or, when all else fails, to help those who succumb to their illness to a better death are at best ignored, and at worst vilified and subject to threats and/or reprisals.  <newline>  <newline> In retrospect, *per* usual, with the advantage of several months' distance, now I’ve had the chance to re-examine that thinking and see its simplistic, emotionally-driven conclusions for what they were:  a consequence, at least in part, of the kind of black-and-white thinking that we autistics can be prone to - one where our passions sweep away all nuance and mitigating factors.  (I was also, at the time, experiencing a dangerous reaction to a prescribed medication - that didn't exactly help my state of mind, either.) <newline>  <newline> Years before all the World War I centenary commemorations of the past decade, the history and cultural resonances of that conflict found their way into my life, often through sheer chance.  As an undergraduate, I was in a college production of *Oh, What a Lovely War!* around the same time that local film society was showing a series of films set in the period (such classics as *King and Country*, *Paths of Glory*, *The Big Parade* and *Gallipoli*).  The year before, thanks to some quirks of scheduling, I had taken a history course on the years leading up to the war.   <newline>  <newline> It was through this semi-immersion into a single historical event that I realised that the facts on the ground - or immortalised in a textbook - can gel into so many cold, impersonal statistics: but the art inspired by and dedicated to these events has the power to pierce our armour of objectivity, and force us to confront the horror and tragedy on a human scale.    <newline>  <newline> Just last week, I had the chance to see the new version of *Im Westen nichts Neues \[All Quiet on the Western Front\]*, and what should have been obvious (but something I believe most of us tend to avoid considering) hit me:  in conflict - as in an epidemic, or even an individual bout of serious illness - no one wins.   <newline>  <newline> One side may feel vindicated when an aggressor is defeated: we may feel relief when we go into remission, or a virulent disease is suppressed - eradicated even - but something is irrevocably lost in the process:  whether lives, material security, our way of life or “merely” our innocence.   At its best, though, good art - even when it ""tears us apart"" - helps us put the pieces back together. <newline>  <newline> One day, hopefully, Ukraine will drive out the aggressors and its people will live in peace again: perhaps a cure may be found for COVID - or, dare I say it, even AIDS.  But in all these cases the loss endures: and art is both our solace and our reminder.   <newline>  <newline> [WWI centenary memorial poppies, Tower of London, 2018\`](https://preview.redd.it/xguylvdcg2ka1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1456e5e21152cdbeb30fc972210e556468e03db9) <newline>  <newline> [NAMES Project AIDS memorial quilt, National Mall, 1996](https://preview.redd.it/kgtko26sg2ka1.jpg?width=696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e411efdcc2279b3842067cf80d15e4909870293) <newline>  <newline> [COVID memorial, National Mall, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ln30q8l9h2ka1.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0f86cd01fbbd3bfd3a23ad514684258db92f5c0b) <newline>  <newline> [\\""Alley of Glory\\"", Kharkiv cemetery, February 2023](https://preview.redd.it/0dl24g6lh2ka1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=899fb1fc1cfe8760b8f2adffcacffb059252d628)";DevilsChurn;False;2;0.92;2023-02-24 05:14:08;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/11aj9hr/on_the_anniversary_of_the_invasion_of_ukraine/;weirdoldbroads
296;11010hm;A Book Lovers Thread;Hello my fellow weird old broads! <newline>  <newline> https://preview.redd.it/budajob28nha1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2d31aa9603142fbf6e56f0ac927cc1d488d66b2 <newline>  <newline> As the title states, I thought would start a thread for the bibliophiles in the group! This particular post has a second agenda and that is to share some of the books that have helped me on my path to seeking a diagnosis and books that helped me to learn what being autistic means to me! <newline>  <newline> **This picture is of a stack of thirteen books in front of a sunny window with the blinds closed.** <newline>  <newline> From top to bottom: <newline>  <newline> The Electricity of Every Living Thing by Katherine May <newline>  <newline> Divergent Mind by Jenara Nerenberg <newline>  <newline> Neurotribes by Steve Silberman <newline>  <newline> Unmasking Autism by Devon Price <newline>  <newline> Between Women by Luise Eichenbaum and Susie Orbach <newline>  <newline> The Comfort Book by Matt Haig <newline>  <newline> Trust by Kylie Scott <newline>  <newline> Eating in the Light of the Moon by Dr. Anita Johnston <newline>  <newline> Wintering by Katherine May <newline>  <newline> Nerdy, Shy, and Socially Inappropriate by Cynthia Kim <newline>  <newline> Neanderthal Seeks Human by Penny Reid <newline>  <newline> You Were Born For This by Chani Nicolas <newline>  <newline> The Girl He Used to Know by Tracey Garvis Graves <newline>  <newline> The top four books I have yet to read but I thought I would include them for discussion purposes and to hear others thoughts about them. <newline>  <newline> **Between Women** <newline>  <newline> I am sharing this book as it was recommended to me by one of my former therapists and I think it is incredibly helpful in learning how to navigate female friendships. <newline>  <newline> **The Comfort Book** <newline>  <newline> This book is written by Matt Haig who also wrote The Midnight Library. He recently discovered that he is neurodiverse and shared his diagnosis publicly. I really enjoy following him on Instagram as I find him to be incredibly empathetic and open and honest about his mental health struggles. <newline>  <newline> **Trust** <newline>  <newline> This is a YA romance novel that features a plus size heroine who doesn’t try to change her body in any way and falls in love just as she is. It’s a beautifully written, steamy, slow burn romance between two young people who experienced a traumatic event. I have read it many times now. <newline>  <newline> **Eating in the Light of the Moon** <newline>  <newline> I believe this to be the best book on eating disorder recovery that there is. I share it because I know many autistic people struggle with eating disorders and I know many of us here in our midlife struggle with disordered eating due to the culture we were raised in. Just a gentle heads up that this book was written before the current gender revolution that we are experiencing and it speaks a lot about masculine and feminine genders in a way that many younger people or gender diverse people may not appreciate. I still believe it’s worth reading if you are a woman who struggles in any way with food and eating. <newline>  <newline> **Wintering** <newline>  <newline> Katherine May is an autistic author who I really would love to be friends with! She’s just so lovely. This particular book is a creative non fiction book that explores those difficult and dark periods in our lives. Her other book The Electricity of Every Living Thing (which I have yet to read) explores her path to a diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> **Nerdy, Shy, and Socially Inappropriate** <newline>  <newline> I’m only part way through this book so far but it’s definitely an interesting read. It’s written almost like an owners manual for Aspies. <newline>  <newline> **Neanderthal Seeks Human** <newline>  <newline> This is a romance novel by one of my favourite authors who also happens to be autistic! This particular book likely wouldn’t be considered her best but it was the first she wrote and the first I read. Like Trust, I think this book was so special to me because I saw for the first time pieces of myself in the main character of a romance novel. <newline>  <newline> **You Were Born For This** <newline>  <newline> You may have figured out by now that I have gone through eating disorder recovery. One of the things encouraged in many recovery programs is connecting with your spiritual side. I struggled with this a lot and then I discovered Chani Nicolas. She is an astrologer (yes, I know I would have rolled my eyes before too) who has a background in social work and I absolutely love her approach to astrology. She uses it as a tool to foster self-awareness, self-discovery and self-acceptance. I definitely recommend if you are a skeptic who is trying to find a way to introduce some spirituality to your life. <newline>  <newline> **The Girl He Used to Know** <newline>  <newline> This is a women’s fiction novel with an autistic main character and it made me sob. I don’t believe the author is autistic herself but she has an adult daughter who is and I feel she did a beautiful job creating a heroine who is incredibly relatable.;Actually_Ann;False;12;1.0;2023-02-11 23:23:28;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/11010hm/a_book_lovers_thread/;weirdoldbroads
297;10h7yr9;Some thoughts on 20 January and our innate sense of justice;"No one has ever accused me of being a ""glass half full"" person. <newline>  <newline> But I'm reminded, on this day, of something I saw exactly two years ago, which I provide - despite the fact that I am anything but a fan of this particular musician - as an *aide-mémoire* to my fellow weird old broads: <newline>  <newline> [20 January 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2IGoEqneac) <newline>  <newline> Two years' removal from that sense of relief and optimism has likely blunted our memory of just how desperately awful and frightening the previous four years had been.  A lot of energy, it seems, is still being wasted on sniping and vitriol from the Left:  thanks to impatience with the pace of change and, in the classic phrase, ""letting the perfect be the enemy of the good"". <newline>  <newline> I wonder if we autistics tend to feel such sentiments more readily, not only with our occasional tendency to black-and-white thinking but, more piquantly, our innate sense of justice and fairness. <newline>  <newline> We don't like token gestures, or obfuscation - we want naked honesty and admission of guilt.  We don't want apologies, we want restitution.  We tend not to like ""new normals"", and can often waste a lot of energy wishing things could go back the way they were (having recently moved back to the area where I grew up, I am as much, if not more, guilty of that stance than anyone else). <newline>  <newline> Ageing can bring both a sense of perspective, but also one of urgency as well.  Having grown up in the 70s means that I have watched the pendulum swing to the Right much more frequently - and increasingly further - than it has in the opposite direction.  My life - my autism notwithstanding - feels like a constant process of losing ground. <newline>  <newline> On one hand, observing the passage of time is itself a reality check into the potential versus the practicable - in society as well as in our individual lives.  On the other hand, each passing year sees a diminution of opportunity not only for things in the world to get better in my lifetime, but for *my* life circumstances - despite my best efforts - to get better as well. <newline>  <newline> One wonders, as is illustrated in this clip from the excellent *Land and Freedom,* whether a push for the ideal is necessary to ""move the needle"" - or whether, in doing so, we alienate the very potential allies that we *need* to have any measure of success: <newline>  <newline> [Land Collectivisation Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B3JChcOIQI) <newline>  <newline> Those who are conversant with the history presented here need not be reminded what happened to the people depicted in this movie.  The retributions by the Franco government were brutal.  The number of mass graves in Spain is second only to Cambodia. <newline>  <newline> So, after two years of some gratification, many disappointments and lingering fear over what will happen in the future, sometimes I think that a more germane performance of the above-referenced song should be this one: <newline>  <newline> [A Python's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwgRzU8oc4Y) <newline>  <newline> (Trust classic SNL - a show that essentially lost its mojo after the 90s - to give us a punchline here.)";DevilsChurn;False;2;1.0;2023-01-20 20:58:41;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/10h7yr9/some_thoughts_on_20_january_and_our_innate_sense/;weirdoldbroads

299;1050tj3;My problem with the 'autism' label is that nobody knows what it means;The first time I thought about autism as something other than the Rain Man type was when a friend of mine at work went to a great deal of trouble and expense to get herself diagnosed. She told me about it and I could tell it meant a lot to her, but at first I had a really hard time getting my head around it. <newline>  <newline> Autistic people were weird, I thought, but she was literally the least weird person I knew. She was just like me! (I don't know why it took me so long to click.)  <newline>  <newline> Now, many years later, and having read a lot on Twitter, I can see that so much of my experience has been shared by so many people, and the label they call it is 'autism' - I am autistic.  <newline>  <newline> But people who haven't spent all this time reflecting on the subject don't have this perspective. They are still like I was when my friend told me about her diagnosis, with preconceived ideas that had nothing to do with my friend. Most people don't understand the term the way that we do, and I have zero interest in discussing the meaning of the term, with gatekeepers and manipulators and people who don't actually care about it as anything more than a fun (for them) thought experiment. <newline>  <newline> What has your experience with the label been?;Chenopodius;False;21;0.98;2023-01-06 18:00:53;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/1050tj3/my_problem_with_the_autism_label_is_that_nobody/;weirdoldbroads
300;zkmeeq;Another generational call-out: Vale Angelo Badalamenti;"The only reason why I even *had* a TV was because I had married someone who didn't know how to entertain himself without one.  It was one of the rare evenings when I happened not to have a rehearsal and, in my apartment on Cathedral Hill in San Francisco, I tuned in out of curiosity to a TV show that I had read was being directed by someone I had met at a showing at Berkeley's Pacific Film Archive a few years earlier (btw, he was a lovely guy, very gracious and generous with his time and attention with this film nerd who peppered him with questions). <newline>  <newline> This is what I saw and heard: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFMaEIHIrGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFMaEIHIrGw) <newline>  <newline> As someone who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, seeing various visual tropes of the landscape and the culture reflected through the fun-house mirror of David Lynch's particular manner of temporal and visual storytelling, coupled with Angelo Badalamenti's score, was transformative for me.  For the first time in my life, I saw what I considered to be an inferior medium - television - with new eyes, and recognised that it had the potential to mirror some of the great artistry I had enjoyed on the big screen for so many years. <newline>  <newline> One of the ""hidden"" attributes of the show - and of Lynch's work in general - is his approach to sound design:  something I only came to understand later in my life when I went into the field myself.

301;yr6nd0;Vale Gal Costa;"I've made clear that I don't particularly hold with the whole concept of ""special interests"" for autistic people.  ""What's *your* special interest?"" is something I've heard from other autistic people before.  As I mentioned in my [personal introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/s4ftnz/comment/hsqsyhx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this sub, I've had a number of ""obsessions"", whether transient or life-long.  As far as I'm concerned, you don't have to have **a single, specific** ""special interest"" to be autistic, you just have to have the capacity to maintain a passionate, focussed fascination with a subject - even if it ""burns itself out"" in the short term. <newline>  <newline> One of the more enduring interests in my life was the Brazilian jazz and Tropicália movements of the 70s.  I didn't discover it until had mostly passed into history, and a number of its artists had either died or become ""national treasures"" - but the dynamism and the political messages of the music still resonated with me, even into the 80s (when I first encountered it) and beyond. <newline>  <newline> I read today that one of the leading lights of the Tropicália movement, Gal Costa, has died, aged 77.  I'll admit that she was actually my **second**\-favourite singer of that era, but I thought that I'd share a bit of her artistry through a wonderful duet with my favourite Brazilian singer, Elis Regina: <newline>  <newline> [Amor até o fim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMUdyPDvVI&list=PL5906C984B103FBD1&index=8) <newline>  <newline> It's an old TV clip from the 70s - but the skill and creativity displayed by these two brilliant vocal musicians, especially in their improv, to my mind transcends the less than stellar video quality in this clip (thankfully, the most important element - the audio - is clear). <newline>  <newline> Plus:  get a load of those **polyrhythms**.";DevilsChurn;False;5;0.88;2022-11-10 05:46:13;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/yr6nd0/vale_gal_costa/;weirdoldbroads

I can't imagine how stressful it must be for these poor people (who are mostly putting in long hours with little to no pay *out of the goodness of their hearts*) who are doing this work now. <newline>  <newline> Also, I currently live in a *very* red area in a blue state that might *actually flip* this year (which it did once before when I was growing up here, so it's not unheard of). <newline>  <newline> We old broads are no longer of child-bearing age, but the Dobbs decision is just the thin edge of the wedge as far as the rights of marginalised groups are concerned.  As women, we are already vulnerable to intimidation (and even violence), and more so as autistic women - and as older autistic women, even more so. <newline>  <newline> Where I live (and where I lived previously - in another state), even the *children* of my ignorant (and often drug-addicted) neighbours verbally harass me, and occasionally vandalise my property - merely because I'm an older woman living alone (and if they knew about my politics, I'd be even *more* apprehensive). <newline>  <newline> I've been to Northern Ireland during the troubles, and I not only saw the burned-out houses, but felt the unremitting tension of being in a literal war zone - and I don't fancy that happening here: but I'm starting to worry. <newline>  <newline> Again, I don't want this to be a space to air our exclusively *personal* problems - but this topic is about **how we interface with society**, which is a major issue for those of us with autism: so I'd like to encourage anyone else here to air their opinions about it as well. <newline>  <newline> In addition, as this is a sub dedicated to **problem-solving** above all, any suggestions that you can offer the rest of us in dealing with this stress or reframing our perspective (beyond the anodyne ""take a hot bath"", ""go for a walk"" or ""spend time with your pets/friends/loved ones"" - which are not options available to many of us) would be welcome. <newline>  <newline> \[Also, let me add, I'm fully aware that - thanks to a handful of occasions of idiocy from the left in the past decade (versus the *thousands* of documented threats from the right just this year) - this can be considered something that affects ""both sides"".  But please don't insult our intelligence by drawing even the *tiniest* of equivalences.  Plus, I'm not talking about garden-variety property crime, or an isolated internecine gang shooting in a far-away urban centre here - I'm talking about *directed* violence with a *political* motivation.\] <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------ <newline>  <newline> Oh, and one more thing, for those of you who appreciate an intelligent cultural recommendation:  check out [*Babylon Berlin*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAn3RXeCrLg), a German TV programme about the years surrounding the start of the Great Depression and the rise of fascism.

305;wn5zfc;ADOS;I only came to suspect I am autistic this year. Previously, even when one of my autistic friends asked me if I had autism, I said no, because I think I am (and was then) an empathetic person and at the time I cared somewhat what other people thought. (Much less so now! I love getting older in some ways.) <newline>  <newline> I have been getting accessed by a psychologist for autism over the last few weeks. She said sometimes she can just have a few sessions with someone and give them a kinda informal diagnosis based on her observations. I liked this idea as it would be cheaper than a full eval. I had one session with just her and one with my husband and me.  <newline>  <newline> She was not able to determine if I was autistic from these sessions, which surprised me somewhat. On Wednesday I will be taking the ADOS to see if I am truly autistic.  <newline>  <newline> I don't know what to think. Autism seemed like a grand unifying theory for the issues I have. Before I thought I had autism I just thought I was bad at life. Sure, there are many other issues I have (OCD, depression, somehow four sleeping disorders, a seizure disorder, etc) but I feel so seen by the autism community. I feel like a fraud, like a person who picks their diagnoses from TikTok videos. Even though my attempt at watching TikTok was super overwhelming. (It just plays, it's bullshit, I felt assaulted by videos and they were all dumb normie shit.) <newline>  <newline> I don't even know what I am hoping to get from posting this.

306;wjqg1k;New Idea: THINKTANK - video sessions devoted to objective discussions of how we interface with the world;"I've been thinking about this for a little while, and want to know if anyone here would be interested in the occasional short Zoom/Skype/FaceTime session in which we can feel free to discuss deeper topics than those which featured in our previous video chats. <newline>  <newline> More, shall we say, cocktail hour than *kaffeeklatsch*. <newline>  <newline> Not that we can't have *fun* or talk about things we enjoy, but I'd like to create a space in which we don't feel compelled to expend the energy to ""put on our happy faces"" or skate across more substantive subjects (we're forced to do that enough in other parts of our lives as it is). <newline>  <newline> My idea is that we can put our heads together to help one another find resources and/or solutions where possible, BUT that it not be anything resembling a therapy session or support group.  So here's what I envision: <newline>  <newline> 1. Interpersonal issues with family, partner, friends, etc would **not** be on the agenda (not only do we not know the other people involved, but that's what trained therapists are for) <newline> 2. Same goes for deeply personal struggles - mental health issues, addiction, or anything else that really needs to be dealt with in a professional setting <newline> 3. Topics *can* include troubleshooting our ""outside"" interactions:  e.g., workplace, neighbourhood, and community dynamics: dealing with businesses, bureaucracies or individual **medical** (not mental health) providers <newline> 4. The focus would be primarily on **problem-solving**, and helping one another find resources to tackle the issues at hand - with the understanding that sometimes just talking about them objectively in a more impersonal setting (and, often, finding out that you're not alone) can go a long way towards improving a situation <newline> 5. This, however, could also be a space where we can express anxiety, concern, worry, etc about greater issues that leave us feeling powerless:  so a bit of mild commiseration about politics, the economy, or the general state of the world is fine - though finding a way to laugh (or even joke) about it should probably be a goal here, too! <newline>  <newline> Again, I have no issue with devolving into chewing the fat on our favourite movies, books, TV shows, etc - but if you have no place to discuss things that are bothering you these days and feel the need to do so, I wouldn't shut you down (as long as they don't stray into the topics covered in #1 and #2, above). <newline>  <newline> What does anyone think?

307;vz2r7v;"Ageist condescension masquerading as a performative ""act of kindness""";"I had seen the video before and considered it more than a little facile - but when I read this [story](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/14/melbourne-woman-dehumanised-by-viral-tiktok-filmed-without-her-consent?utm_term=62cffe390dd6904d7ce89abbf94cee03&utm_campaign=GuardianTodayUS&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&CMP=GTUS_email) in the Guardian about the reaction of the object of an ""act of kindness"" it truly disturbed me. <newline>  <newline> For those of you who haven't seen it:  a young man approaches an older woman minding her own business in a public place, asks her to hold a bouquet of flowers while he puts on his jacket, then walks away, leaving her holding the flowers. <newline>  <newline> So heartwarming, eh?  So ***nauseating*** - not to mention insulting. <newline>  <newline> It turns out that there's a lot more to the story than presented.  The woman didn't want to be disturbed: she tried to give the kid back the flowers because she didn't want them: and, most saliently, ***she asked whether she was being filmed, and he LIED about it***. <newline>  <newline> This patronising stunt was performed for no other reason than to serve as some twisted ""PR"" by the young man in the video.  If he *really* wanted to do something kind for the woman, he should have started by asking her if she wished to be disturbed in the first place.  If she really *had* wanted some company, he might have sat down and actually made friends with her - but no, that would have been *icky*: after all, who wants to hang out with old women? <newline>  <newline> Most importantly, whatever he might have been inspired to do:  if he had been truly sincere, **he wouldn't have done it on camera**. <newline>  <newline> Am I the only one who finds this - and, to be frank, a lot of these staged ""kindnesses"" - more than a little offensive? <newline>  <newline> It seems these days that older women are either nasty K----s to be volubly denigrated, or objects of pity to have meaningless (and often unwanted) public gestures made towards them in order to make the performers feel better about themselves - plus, don't forget, **it has to be captured on video so that the whole world can provide them with the validation they evidently so desperately need**. <newline>  <newline> This just makes me want to vomit.";DevilsChurn;False;7;0.99;2022-07-14 18:27:37;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/vz2r7v/ageist_condescension_masquerading_as_a/;weirdoldbroads
308;vhw6u1;PTSD from today's hearing;"It was nowhere near as bad for me as Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in the Kavanaugh hearing (that led to a full-blown breakdown for several months), but today's hearing brought up some bad past history for me. <newline>  <newline> I've been an election worker, and found myself subjected to the same type of abuse that the Georgia election workers who testified today described - obviously, though, I'm fortunate in that it was nothing compared to what they went through. <newline>  <newline> It's not exactly a fun job - election day is usually about 18 hours long, from setting up in the wee hours of the morning, to taking care of the post-closure paperwork and tear-down that can stretch close to midnight: plus there's a mandatory 3-4 hours of training before *every* election.  For all of this you get paid about $150, not even minimum wage.  (Thank goodness I live in a vote by mail state now.) <newline>  <newline> I've also volunteered for ""get out of the vote"" drives as far back as the early 90s - which can feel worthwhile, but can also expose one to ""blowback"" from the public, depending on how well they've been organised (and, in my experience, they've gotten worse over the years).  But it's **important work**, and there are times when I feel compelled to at least do *something*. <newline>  <newline> This whole attack by the Right on the elections process has been going on for *years*.  The last election I worked was nearly **ten years ago** in California, and I had people regularly coming in accusing me of allowing people to vote who ""weren't supposed to"" (interesting how these accusers never exactly specified who these ""illegitimate"" voters were). <newline>  <newline> Having had this happen for a few years already, I tried to ignore it, though it really upset me every time.  These people weren't just accusing us of acting dishonourably, but also of *breaking the law*.  At the beginning of election day, before we opened, we always gathered around and swore an oath to uphold the laws of the State of California - so anyone who accused me of facilitating illegal voting was in essence calling me a criminal. <newline>  <newline> During the last election I worked I finally lost it with someone.  It was about 7 in the evening, and I had been up since 4 that morning, with all of a half hour's break the entire time I was at the polling place (which I used to go my neighbourhood precinct to cast my own ballot).  About a half hour before the incident, a middle-aged Russian woman came in with her elderly mother, and informed me that this was the first time that her mother was voting in the US.  This was the sort of thing that people like me do the work for - I was blinking back tears with a huge grin on my face when I signed this old lady in for her first election. <newline>  <newline> Then a little while later the umpteenth ""swinging d\*\*k"" came in and loudly announced that I was breaking election laws - and I couldn't contain myself.  I started to get into it with him, and thankfully the poll manager stepped in before it could escalate too far. <newline>  <newline> Thankfully, it went no further, and none of it went public - I didn't have to deal with what that poor woman who testified today experienced. <newline>  <newline> But I have had something like that happen, and it's terrifying. <newline>  <newline> In 2010 I had a job with the Census, and we faced a similar political climate, thanks to Rupert f\*\*\*\*\*\*g Murdoch (may he burn in Hell) and his minions.  We were pushed to be aggressive with people in getting responses, and our workload depended upon our success.  I was seriously hurting financially, the Census had overhired, and there wasn't enough work to go around - so I was especially desperate to prove myself and get as many hours as possible while there were still assignments to be had. <newline>  <newline> However, thanks to a load of codswallop that the right-wing press had fed these low-rent idiots that I was sent to interview, I had people threaten to turn their dogs on me, warn me to clear out or they would fetch their gun, threaten me with assault, call me all manner of delightful (usually gendered) names, slam doors in my face, and mete out still more generic verbal abuse in the course of the weeks that I did the job. <newline>  <newline> One night, when I returned (as arranged) to interview a guy who had given me a horrifically hard time the evening before, I was greeted with a BANG on the inside of the door so loud that it frightened the wits out of me, followed by the resident sticking his head out and yelling a torrent of expletive-laced abuse at me before slamming the door in my face. <newline>  <newline> My response was to leave the customary ""We Missed You"" note with my name and number, asking him to call me to finish the interview, and leaving a comment that was, shall we say, borderline disrespectful (depending on how you wished to interpret it), ending with ""I'm just doing my job"".  It was the end of a long, hot day: I had already had some extremely difficult encounters already, and I was plainly fed up. <newline>  <newline> I received two upsetting phone calls after that:  one about an hour after I got home from the fellow the note was left for, with a non-stop fountain of abuse during which he said, ""**SHUT UP**, I'm not going to let you get a word in edgewise!"" (at which point I hung up the phone): the second came the next evening from a **TV reporter** \- turns out the guy had gone to the media with *his* version of events, and unfortunately had my note as evidence of my ""disrespect"". <newline>  <newline> I tried to give my side of things, and got a promise from the reporter to not run the story until he had spoken with my supervisor (this was standard operating procedure).  I later spoke with the supervisor, who had not heard from the reporter, so I assumed that the story wouldn't run that evening. <newline>  <newline> More fool I:  not only was the story on the evening news, consisting of little more than the abusive jerk in question getting his 15 seconds of fame on camera talking about how nasty *I* was (and nothing of what he had said to me), but **they showed the note on screen with my name and phone number in plain view,** ***not*** **blurred out**. <newline>  <newline> Now, compared to those poor women in Georgia I was divinely blessed:  the phone calls and messages only lasted a few days and were more creepy than blatantly threatening (more along the lines of ""we know where you live"" and all).  But I was a woman living on my own, I already had neighbours terrorising me, and I had only months before got out of a job where I was targeted by coworkers and had some ""accidental"" near-miss incidents in the car park.  I was already, shall we say, a bit jumpy at that point as it were. <newline>  <newline> That was when I started carrying pepper spray on me whenever I ventured into public, started going to shops a half hour's drive from my house instead of the ones in the neighbourhood, and spiralled down into what ultimately turned into several years of severe agoraphobia. <newline>  <newline> Oh, and I got fired from the Census job - just like I got fired from nearly every public contact job I've ever had.  It was a few months later that I first started learning about autism in women, and another seven years before I found myself with the diagnosis - but I don't think it would have helped in those days to have known about how ill-suited I was to public contact work, as I literally couldn't afford to turn it down. <newline>  <newline> My name and phone number showed up for a few seconds on a Sunday night local news broadcast in 2010 - before I owned a smart phone, shortly before I deleted my Facebook profile and long before the Mango Mussolini injected his poisonous accelerant into a smouldering populace.  I can't imagine what I would do if something like what happened to the women who testified today happened to me now:  still living alone, in compromised physical health, in a neighbourhood full of drug addicts, petty criminals and right-wing nut-jobs - and a lot of **guns**. <newline>  <newline> At least I don't have any family to worry about becoming ""collateral damage"".";DevilsChurn;False;2;0.93;2022-06-22 04:13:25;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/vhw6u1/ptsd_from_todays_hearing/;weirdoldbroads
309;vfj0yu;Seeing your lifetime in historical drama - this is for the OLD broads;"Yesterday (17 May) was the 50th anniversary of the Watergate break-in.  Never mind the strained parallels that pundits and the like are trying to draw between then and now, there has also been a new drama based on the Watergate scandal on TV recently - so of course I couldn't bear to miss it. <newline>  <newline> Over the past few weeks, I've had the opportunity to take in a lot of interesting, historically-based TV - all of it set in periods that I remember, even if I wasn't a fully-formed adult at the time. <newline>  <newline> How do you feel seeing part of your lifespan on screen?   <newline>  <newline> One of the things I like to do for fun is to point out the anachronistic use of music - every now and then a song will play a few years before it was released (or, if it *had* ""technically"" been released, it wasn't on regular rotation on the radio for another 6-12 months): others like to check out whether the clothes or interior décor is appropriate to the time.  (One of the great things about *Mad Men* is that the design team went out of their way not to make everything look straight out of the period - whether clothes, furniture, cars, etc - because our actual lives are usually a mix of items that are new and those we've had for a while.) <newline>  <newline> Of course, I'm also taken back to what my life was like during those periods - which for me tends not to be a particularly pleasant endeavour.  But it's also an interesting way to take stock of how much has - and, sadly, *hasn't* \- changed since then, whether in one's life or in the wider society. <newline>  <newline> If you are old enough to remember what life was like during some of these times - and not ""I wasn't born/was just an infant, and this is what my parents told me things were like"" - then I'd love to have your reactions to what you yourself were thinking about things back then, especially if you have any memories of the events that took place in the shows I mention. <newline>  <newline> Or, if you've seen any other interesting dramas based any time during the past 50 years, what sort of reaction have you had?  Do you like to pick them apart?  Do they bring up memories?  Or do they lead you to come to new conclusions about what was going on than you did before you viewed them? <newline>  <newline> This is what I've been watching: <newline>  <newline> [***Gaslit:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ-uyTbsWJw)  This is a show about the Watergate scandal, told mostly from the perspective of Martha Mitchell.  If you are old enough to know about Watergate, I don't have to explain to you who she was.  One of the things that I found surprising about the drama was not so much what happened to Martha (I had already listened to the podcast on which it was based), but just how much of a *dick* John Dean was. <newline>  <newline> I myself was old enough to sit on the couch watching the hearings on those warm Summer nights with my folks, and worked hard to understand what was going on.  I didn't know what ""obstruction of justice"" meant, but I had an idea that a lot of the people in power at that time were criminals.  Coming of age during that period irrevocably marked my generation:  years later, a younger friend of mine who was teaching university classes asked me, ""What is it with people right around your age?  They are the most difficult students I have.  They question everything I say.""  My one-word answer:  ""Watergate"". <newline>  <newline> Well, that and the fact that a number of us - or, as in my case, a number of our friends - had elder siblings who were actual Baby Boomers (you know, people who were children *of* the Sixties: as opposed to us, who were children *in* the Sixties) who had already become ""radicalised"" and routinely wore ""Question Authority"" buttons on their well-worn Pendleton shirt/t-shirt/faded jeans/Chucks uniform (you think Kurt Cobain *invented* that outfit?). <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> [***Invisible Heroes:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l52uao0VVD0)  This is a show from Finland (available on Amazon) about Finnish diplomats stationed in Chile during Pinochet's 1973 military coup.  His subsequent reign of terror lasted nearly two decades (these are the guys who threw people out of helicopters).  These brave Finns and other Scandinavian diplomats managed to save over 2000 Chilean dissidents who would have otherwise been butchered by the murderous military usurpers. <newline>  <newline> I remember reading about the assassination of the democratically-elected Salvatore Allende in one of my parents' newsmagazines at the time - but it wasn't until several years later, during a Congressional investigation, that the involvement of the CIA and the US government was revealed. <newline>  <newline> This was just part of a horrific history of US-backed right-wing interventions in South and Central America, that endured for decades, reaching its putative apotheosis during the early 80s, when Reagan and his brownshirts illegally supported anti-democratic insurgents in El Salvador and Nicaragua. <newline>  <newline> It was during those horrific years of the 80s, when the unholy trinity of Reagan, Thatcher and Mulroney appeared to dominate Anglophone (and, by extension, general Western) foreign policy in favour of oppressive régimes from Central and South America to South Africa to Northern Ireland, that I came of age politically in an atmosphere of defeat and despair. <newline>  <newline> I'm reminded of a concert I went to in Berkeley of a Panamanian musician known for the political content of his work, where I first encountered one of the most tragic songs I ever heard.  I'm going to share a link to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6XHiPPiMnk) made of the song, that addresses conditions in Peru at the time - but the lyrics of the song itself could have applied to just about any country in that region, from Paraguay to Nicaragua to Argentina to Chile. <newline>  <newline> \---------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> [***Pistol:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhxwG0eCiE)  The story of the Sex Pistols, based on Steve Jones' autobiography.  I'll be the first to admit that, while I liked the Ramones, I never really got behind the Sex Pistols, especially back when they came out.   <newline>  <newline> Mind you, it took a while for us here to learn about them.  I was actually in London a few months after *God Save the Queen* came out, but the only music news that I was exposed to while I was there was hearing that Elvis had died.  When I first heard the Sex Pistols, all I could think about was how out of tune they were. <newline>  <newline> (I love punk now, but it wasn't until a friend of mine played me some [Nina Hagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re-8FvR1TAI) that I finally got the memo - probably had something to do with the Eastern-accented German she sang in, which I always thought perfectly suited the music.) <newline>  <newline> Seeing the misery of the f\*\*\*ed-up mid- and late 70s, when I had finally started to ""come of age"" socially, and understand just enough of what was going on around me to think that this was the normal state of the ""adult world"" (and not enough to understand how massively screwed up society was at the time) - well, it certainly underscores my conviction that we have little to thank the Sixties for, at least where relations between men and women are concerned. <newline>  <newline> \---------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> [***1992/1993/1994:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZdYZTSuMR4)  A three-series Italian programme about the rise of Silvio Berlusconi and the Right in Italy in the early 1990s.  I enjoyed it for two reasons:  1) it was full of *great* 90s music (from Soundgarden to Grant Lee Buffalo), and 2) it was eerily reminiscent of what has been going on in the rest of the Western world over the past 10-15 years.  It also had a subplot about corporate chicanery being responsible for the spread of AIDS during that time - this had parallels in a number of other countries, including in San Francisco, where I was living at the time (and watching my friends die around me).  Anyone who was living an adult life in the 90s will recognise much of what is portrayed in this fascinating story. <newline>  <newline> \----------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> [***Derry Girls:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFmFuXH0IRY)  More 90s fun (and 90s music!), this time set in Northern Ireland during the years leading up to the Good Friday agreement.  The final series recently ended on Channel 4 in the UK, and should be airing soon everywhere else.  I found this last set of episodes hilarious - and a great way to end the series. <newline>  <newline> To a lot of us outside the British Isles in the 70s, 80s and 90s, the Troubles in Northern Ireland were a distant story (one shaped primarily by partisan British news sources): but when I married an Irish National (who was also a National*ist*) I came to understand the conflict from an ""inside"" perspective.  Visiting Northern Ireland during that period was one of the most stressful ""eye-opening"" experiences I've ever had. <newline>  <newline> Which brings me to one last show, that is not set in the past, but which reminds me of the fractured period of the Troubles: <newline>  <newline> [***Commandments:***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFhkuf22O04)  An Israeli programme (also on Amazon) about Orthodox conscripts in the Israeli forces.  A fascinating portrait of the factionalism within a single culture:  whether between third-generation citizens and more recent Eastern European arrivals: between secular and religious Israelis: between Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Mizrahis: or between insular Hasidim (who are anti-military and non-political) and Haredi ultra-nationalist settlers (the Israeli equivalent of Northern Ireland's UVF:  a state-backed Protestant militia during the Troubles). <newline>  <newline> It's an interesting window into a culture we don't get to see very often: and those of us who know people from that part of the world should find it especially enlightening. <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------------ <newline>  <newline> Right at this moment I'm watching the return of [***Borgen***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmRJiZ4mFQU)***,*** and a French Cold-War drama on Amazon called ***Totems***, set in Europe and North Africa in the early 60s.  So far, I'm enjoying them both, though there are no historic memories to be gleaned from either. <newline>  <newline> Are you watching anything set in the past that brings up memories for you?  Anything that makes you think about the world around us?  That brings up different perspectives and makes you ponder questions you hadn't considered before? <newline>  <newline> The best ""entertainments"" are those that don't just provide ""escape"", but make us think as well.";DevilsChurn;False;4;1.0;2022-06-19 00:20:38;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/vfj0yu/seeing_your_lifetime_in_historical_drama_this_is/;weirdoldbroads

311;tgmffx;Admirable Women - Hannah Gadsby;"Most of us here in North America know Hannah Gadsby for her groundbreaking comedy *Nanette*, in which she essentially deconstructed the genre while daring to speak of misogyny, homophobia and abuse in her life and in society at large, all the while eschewing the ""pill-sweetening"" of the cheap laugh. <newline>  <newline> I was already a fan of hers when *Nanette* was released in 2018, but I remember finding it devastating - especially in the atmosphere of the MeToo revelations and the Kavanaugh hearings that had so many of us reliving the trauma of gendered violence from earlier in our own lives. <newline>  <newline> What many of you may not be familiar with is the work that she did for over a decade in the UK and her native Australia on the comedy circuit and through TV appearances.  Here's a clip from the Australian TV show *In Gordon Street Tonight*, in which Hannah appeared as a co-presenter with the comedian Adam Hills: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fZdcGPNPDk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fZdcGPNPDk) <newline>  <newline> Just last week, they appeared together again on one of my favourite programmes, UK Channel 4's topical disability comedy show (bet you don't see those words together very often), *The Last Leg*: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQgeN89UN2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQgeN89UN2c) <newline>  <newline> It is her comedy around autism, I would imagine, that resonates with most of us on this sub.

312;tbilaq;Admirable Women - Jo Cox;"Jo Cox was a British MP who was murdered by a white supremacist during the Brexit campaign in 2016.  She was 41, and left behind a husband and two young children. <newline>  <newline> She grew up in a working class family in the West Yorkshire community of Batley and Spen, which she later represented after her election to Parliament in 2015.  After graduation from Cambridge and the LSE, she spent her early career working for Oxfam, Save the Children and a number of other organisations advocating for human rights, and for the welfare of women and children. <newline>  <newline> In her maiden speech to Parliament she uttered the quote for which she is now most remembered:  ***""We are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us.""***  During her brief tenure she was known for her intellect, her humanitarian impulses, and her [incisive rhetoric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEVoh9dh6sI) and willingness to hold the ruling Conservative party's feet to the fire. <newline>  <newline> One of the issues she brought to popular attention was the problem of widespread loneliness in our society, to which effort she created a cross-party commission to tackle the problem, and called for the creation of a ministerial position within the government explicitly for the purposes of addressing loneliness.  In 2018, then prime minister Theresa May accepted the commission's report and created a ministerial lead for loneliness: the UK government later that year became the world's first to publish a loneliness reduction strategy. <newline>  <newline> Probably one of the most famous initiatives inspired by Jo Cox's ideas is the [Great Get Together](https://www.jocoxfoundation.org/ggt), sponsored by the Jo Cox Society:  a biannual occasion in which communities and neighbourhoods sponsor gatherings and parties designed to encourage people to reject divisive politics and to celebrate their shared interests. <newline>  <newline> There have also been a number of other programmes created in her name in an attempt to further the aims she promulgated:  including addressing issues such as civility in politics, mutual aid (initiated during the COVID lockdown), mentoring of women in politics, and fighting identity-based violence, particularly in conflict zones. <newline>  <newline> [Jo Cox \(1974-2016\)](https://preview.redd.it/8oicwl47tom81.jpg?width=353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4c52e5cec4b0a43af9725cb0ccac95ffc970a54)";DevilsChurn;False;0;0.83;2022-03-11 05:11:56;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/tbilaq/admirable_women_jo_cox/;weirdoldbroads
313;t9ckep;Admirable Women - Three women filmmakers;"Thanks to spending much of my teens, 20s and 30s haunting the now-moribund cultural oases of ""art-house"" cinemas, film festivals and film institutes (shout out to Berkeley's Pacific Film Archive), I got to know the work of some little-known but fabulous women filmmakers over the years. <newline>  <newline> I'm picking out these three women because they all got their start in the 60s and 70s, and under circumstances in which - for two of them at least - it was difficult for *any* filmmakers to do truly creative work, never mind their sex. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **Larisa Shepitko** was a Ukranian director born in the Soviet Union in 1938.  Despite being the only woman in the film school where she studied, she was able to build an international reputation as a filmmaker of note - and likely would have achieved greater acclaim had she not been killed in an automobile accident while scouting locations in 1979. <newline>  <newline> Her most famous film was the last one she completed before her death, *The Ascent*, about anti-German partisans in Belarus during WWII.  But my favourite is a domestic drama called *You and Me*.  These and her debut film *Wings* are probably the best known of her work in the West.  Unfortunately, there are no decent clips on YouTube to share - but she had a wonderfully spare but visceral visual style that communicated the intensity of her characters' pain and confusion without overstatement. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **Marta Meszaros** is a Hungarian director, now in her 90s, who first came to prominence in the 1960s.  Her best-known film, *Adoption*, is unafraid to show the physicality and sensuality of a woman who would in those days have been considered beyond the age of ""desirability"".  I can't find a clip that best demonstrates this, but there are glimpses in this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOjxTfuI6Lk).   <newline>  <newline> Her first feature, *The Girl*, captures the alienation of its teen protagonist in a manner that underscores the sterility of life in Hungary behind the Iron Curtain.  The only clip I can find doesn't really do the film justice. <newline>  <newline> I haven't had the opportunity to see anything she made from the 80s on - but she is still active, and I live in hope that I get to see more of  her work. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **Margarethe von Trotta** is a German director whose film *Sisters, or the Balance of Happiness* is a favourite of mine.  It can actually be seen in its [entirety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfNknHnbmZE) on YouTube.  This was one of her many films based on female characters that reflected the culture and politics of the 70s and 80s, including *The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum* \[made with her husband, the filmmaker Volker Schlöndorff - who, of course, got all the credit\] and *Marianne and Julianne*. <newline>  <newline> More recently, she has made well-received biopics of Hannah Arendt, Hildegard von Bingen and Rosa Luxembourg, all starring the excellent Barbara Sukowa. <newline>  <newline> One of her more recent films that I especially enjoyed is *Rosenstraße*, about a little-known women's protest during WWII.  The only [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiX1jKGmPa4) I can find has no English subtitles, but it's fairly clear what the story is about. <newline>  <newline> She specialises in telling the stories of women, their sometimes fraught relationships (especially with one another) and the friction between their desire to live life on their own terms and the strictures of the society in which they find themselves. <newline>  <newline> Von Trotta is in her 80s and is still active - and her films have gained wider distribution than that of the other directors in this post, so most of the films mentioned here should be fairly simple to locate.  I would certainly recommend anyone with an interest in a masterful telling of women's stories to check out her work.";DevilsChurn;False;0;1.0;2022-03-08 08:49:30;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/t9ckep/admirable_women_three_women_filmmakers/;weirdoldbroads

Joanna Scanlan didn't try to break into acting until her mid-30s, and then it took another decade to gain the kind of critical and commercial success she enjoys now.  Jo Brand went through the literal rough and tumble of work as a psychiatric nurse before going into comedy - then endured years of audience abuse in the crucible of the alternative comedy circuit of the 80s and 90s. <newline>  <newline> Now they're both BAFTA-winning ""national treasures"".

For three hours, I listened to a room full of men uncomfortably tying themselves into rhetorical knots while discussing the subject of sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace: and I started to feel like I was alone in the world in finding the whole situation appalling. <newline>  <newline> Then this tiny woman from Baltimore - if you're a fan of *The Wire*, she hailed from the area featured in the second season - got up and, haltingly at first, finally spoke up and talked sense.  Here's what she said: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4798504/user-clip-barbara-magna](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4798504/user-clip-barbara-magna) <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> Nearly 30 years later, we got to see Act II of the same, sad drama - this time thanks to another female US Senator: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8mj\_Rhfy\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8mj_Rhfy_A) <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> Thanks to getting so much of my news from sources outside North America, I've come to enjoy some women who have managed to keep their personality and sense of humour intact, even while in the rarified and artifice-driven world of national politics.   <newline>  <newline> This woman is a favourite of mine, here seen calling out the hypocrisy of the ruling classes: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPjdnMF3C-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPjdnMF3C-s) <newline>  <newline> \------------------------------- <newline>  <newline> I don't particularly agree with the politics of this former MSP, but she has always been a good sport - willing to take the mick out of herself with the same alacrity that she used to eviscerate Boris Johnson: <newline>  <newline> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyKg1jcqaGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyKg1jcqaGQ) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Whenever I see this kind of spirited performance from women in a position of influence, I think that maybe the world isn't a total disaster - and I thank them for that.;DevilsChurn;False;0;1.0;2022-03-08 07:24:18;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/t9bdgq/admirable_women_some_female_politicians_that_i/;weirdoldbroads
316;t66ple;TTRPGs and the Struggle with Imagination & Emotion;"I've recently taken up buying TTRPG (tabletop roleplaying game) bundles because I want to try them, but it leads to me banging my head against a wall (both figuratively and literally sometimes) against aphantasia and alexithymia. <newline>  <newline> Aphantasia (to put it simply for my own sake) means I can't see images in my mind's eye and alexithymia is difficulty with describing emotions. As a result, I struggle with playing pretend with others because I can't conceptualize a collective form of play if I've never experienced it in real life. And I also have a hard time identifying emotions that are more specific than ""good"" or ""bad. So when I ""imagine"" things, they're based off of objects/thoughts/emotions that I have direct experience with. And that imagination is purely in words in my head, not images. With emotions, I've tried looking at an emotion wheel but specificity doesn't really help me in those cases. I just feel emotion all over my body and it can be so overwhelming that it can lead to a shutdown if I don't regulate it in time. <newline>  <newline> What does this have to do with TTRPGs? Often these games make their players imagine a fictional world for their play (mostly done with words) and I feel left out because I can't meet that basic level of entry. I remember someone trying to teach me D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) on Discord and I couldn't even get past creating a character sheet. It all felt so arbitrary and artificial. It's also why I struggle with creating OCs (original characters) and those characters end up just reflecting me as a person anyways, perhaps with a more idealized form of appearance. It's really hard for me to imagine something wholly new on my own. <newline>  <newline> I do want to try TTRPG for the interpersonal (and hopefully friendship) component, but I'm also terrified of not getting the process and being a burden onto whoever I'm playing with. <newline>  <newline> Sorry if this feels a bit rambling, but I wonder if anybody else struggles with this.";saiita;False;6;0.72;2022-03-04 01:05:15;/r/weirdoldbroads/comments/t66ple/ttrpgs_and_the_struggle_with_imagination_emotion/;weirdoldbroads

322;qizdjy;Dealing with a skeptical partner;Hi, <newline> I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, since it’s not really a joyful topic, but I thought maybe, being older, I might try it. <newline>  <newline> So, my husband of 14 years and I have been having some rocky times. Our marriage has taken some major hits over the years for a variety of reasons. 11-ish years ago, I got an ADHD diagnosis and it helped with some stuff but he never really gets that I am legitimately different from him, and still thinks I use it as an “excuse” when it’s “convenient.”  <newline>  <newline> It was a relatively recent fight with him that sent me looking into whether or not I have ASD. I asked him if he thought I might be and he admitted he thought so. Our son (12) is on the spectrum. Every test I have taken puts me well within the autistic range. I am looking into it as a way to understand myself better and already it is helping me recognise the patterns in my behaviour and thoughts and make sense of them. I am actually able to get in touch with my emotions a lot more, now that I know they look different for me.  <newline>  <newline> We had another big fight where he was shaming me for things I can’t control, but was managing, because I had failed a secret test he had set for me (long story). We sort of resolved it. Then the other night was our anniversary and he spent a lot of the night complaining about how all the neurodiversity stuff he’s been seeing on Facebook is pathologising really normal stuff and how everyone seems to need to make things into a disease instead of making themselves accountable for their actions. It was bothering me but I didn’t want to have a fight while we were having our anniversary dinner. <newline>  <newline> He keeps saying he thinks of marriage as building a future together and if he had known some of these things about me he might not have had these expectations. If I am honest, I don’t think I would have married him if I knew about his anger issues and how much he expects his partner to read his mind, or how much he needs to dump emotionally on everyone around him, or how he thinks resentment is perfectly normal and justified. <newline>  <newline> He doesn’t believe in therapy. He has major depression which he refuses to treat, and which occasionally develops into psychosis. He sometimes uses this fact, that he manages, to justify his skepticism about other conditions, like that he “doesn’t use it as an excuse.” For the record, I don’t use my diagnosis as an excuse. <newline>  <newline> My therapist said my relationship is abusive. I am starting to think she might be right. I think I deserve to be treated better. But I don’t know what to do with that. It’s too much. We have two kids, we just bought a house together and are moving interstate in a few weeks. I’m turning 41 in December.

324;q51u4d;Joys, dreams, “grinspirations” and how to reconnect with them;*(First, I’m going to apologise for the quality of the video clips, as they were all I could find. Plus: I’m not going to label them as spoilers, as they don’t really give away the plot - plus they’re from a movie that’s over* ***30 years old****.)* <newline>  <newline> I was in the middle an abusive marriage when I saw this movie, and ended up in bits just during the opening credits: <newline>  <newline> [SV titles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP14hH8wWu4) <newline>  <newline> It got worse during this pivotal scene in the second act: <newline>  <newline> [Such a little life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRKlrQZZ82g) <newline>  <newline> At the time, I was a shell of the person I had been only a few years before, and was still struggling to establish a career in classical music that had already been hamstrung by crippling performance anxiety (the genesis of which was an incident that took place just months before graduating from Uni), violent opposition from my husband, and what we now refer to as #MeToo issues (which were just as rife in classical music as they were in the other performing arts). <newline>  <newline> Years later, having extricated myself from the situation, I actually ended up doing that second act monologue (and a few others from the play on which the movie is based besides) in acting classes and auditions, as part of my “rebuilding” process. <newline>  <newline> **So I know it can be done.** <newline>  <newline> I had several lovely years of rekindling numerous joys in my life (not just the jubilant recovery of my love of performing) - until I encountered another run of serial “smackdowns” over the course of a few years that have not only broken my spirit, but this time my health as well. <newline>  <newline> At this point I’m not even sure what my sources of joy are any longer: I don’t know if it’s depression/trauma/fatigue that’s keeping me from experiencing that old pleasure, or whether it’s because my “go-to” sources may no longer be germane at this point in my life. For all I know, there may be older “grinspirations” that I lost touch with even further back: or - who knows? - even new ones that I haven’t yet encountered! <newline>  <newline> From an early age we have been conditioned to cut ourselves off from perfectly healthy impulses that were deemed too “childish” or “impractical” by those who wanted to reinforce conformity and silence. I think such deprivation can continue to blight our lives, however subconsciously, even into middle and old age. <newline>  <newline> **Do you have any “lost” or “secret” joys that you’ve wished to reconnect with?

325;q51k8p;Welcome!;"***\[Updated 24 March 2023\]*** <newline>  <newline> Hi everyone. Thanks for visiting.  I hope that you can find information of value here - and, hopefully, some mental stimulation as well! <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to make known what I had in mind here: <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***First:*** This is a sub primarily for women who were diagnosed - or either suspected their autism or had it recognised - in middle age: as there is a significant difference between those who are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, and those of us who have had to struggle through childhood, adolescence and adulthood undiagnosed and without recognition of, never mind assistance with, our difficulties. <newline>  <newline> In addition, those of us born before 1980 also had to deal with a level of sexism and discrimination that, I've discovered, many younger women really don't tend to fully appreciate. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***Second:*** I used the words “suspected” and “recognised” above, which is how I tend to think of those who either “self-diagnose” (a term which has become stigmatised in both the medical and mental health spheres), see themselves reflected in stories about women with autism, or have been “recognised” by others who have suggested the possibility to them. <newline>  <newline> I myself suspected my autism seven years before I was diagnosed - and considering the difficulties that women - especially older women - face in being diagnosed in the first place, I see no issue with referring to one’s self as autistic, even minus a formal diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***Third:*** As I've indicated in the rules, topics not related to autism are encouraged here.  I would love this to be a place where we can exchange our views and ideas on issues in the outside world, our beliefs, our interests and generally what entertains and/or delights us! <newline>  <newline> As long as discussion remains rational and respectful, then I encourage all of you to bring up things that are on your mind, even if they have nothing whatsoever to do with autism. <newline>  <newline> *NB:* disagreement, as long as it doesn't contain *ad hominem* \[personal\] attacks, does **not** constitute disrespect.  Also, strongly-worded divergence of opinion - again, without descending into personal attack - is not being ""mean"" or ""aggressive"".  If someone wishes to express their strong feelings about an issue, and they do so in a manner that sticks to the topic, that is **not** an attack. <newline>  <newline> Also, **this is a mean girl-free zone**.  Leave the sarcasm and withering put-downs in the junior high locker room. <newline>  <newline> Think of this space like a dinner party, where lively and intelligent discussion can take place, and people bring their ""A-game"" to the table in terms of thoughtfulness and civility.  Let's be grown-ups here - and express ourselves in a mature and practical manner. <newline>  <newline> **Please note** that I said ""dinner party"", not ""support group"" or ""late-night wine sessions with your girlfriends"".  I have more to say about that below. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***Fourth:***  Please consider the purpose of a thread before you post.  It should be to inform, entertain, problem-solve or spark discussion.  Think of it in terms of what you are *contributing* to the sub. <newline>  <newline> If you are looking for specific information on dealing with bureaucracy, medical/mental health systems, workplace issues, or coping strategies in a particular situation, ***phrase your post in the form of a question***, in a manner that invites **rational** discussion (""stealth"" questions that are masking little more than a bid for emotional support don't count). <newline>  <newline> Please use the flair ""SEEKING ADVICE"" for these questions, to flag the purpose of the post. <newline>  <newline> Especially as regards legal questions, indicating your location is a great help to finding advice germane to your jurisdiction.  I'm gratified in the fact that we have users here from all over the world, so the potential for getting resources and information that will be useful for you is greater if we know where you are.  It will also save you from filtering through responses that aren't applicable to your country/region.  (If you haven't already, you can contact the mod through DM \[NOT CHAT\] for assignment of location flair.) <newline>  <newline> weirdoldbroads is not a place to rant, vent or dump your feelings.  If you are looking for nothing more than ""oh, you poor thing""-type responses, please go to one of the other autistic women's subs, where I'm sure you will find plenty of users willing to accommodate you. <newline>  <newline> Similarly, this is not a place to do nothing more than try to ""harvest"" approbation.  If you want to be congratulated for something from your personal life that you've done/realised/discovered, there are other places for that, too.  This also applies to any self-satisfied ""inspiration porn""-type posts - as far as I'm aware, Instagram is still extant: so if you want to make it all about yourself, you can go there. <newline>  <newline> There are three exceptions to this: <newline>  <newline> 1. Informative updates from previous problem-solving posts.  If you have feedback on the advice you received, or further information you've acquired through your process, please feel free to share with us.  You can do so either by editing your original post or by creating a new post, preferably with the ""UPDATE"" flair for those who wish to filter for it. <newline> 2. Funny stories about something that might have happened to you related to your autism - especially recently.  The flair ""FUNNY STORIES"" has been created for these.  Again, they should be for entertainment purposes, and centre more about the strange interface between our world and that of the ""normies"" - and not just ""look at me and how cute/smart/funny I am!"" or ""humble brags"". <newline> 3. Threads that mention your life, but invite others to chime in.  Examples are ""What are you doing this Summer?"", ""Let's share our favourite books/movies/TV shows"" (this topic is prime ""NERD ALERT!"" territory) or - on rare occasion - mass processing of a significant event in the wider world (a thread I posted about the 2022 elections in the US is a case in point). <newline>  <newline> If you wish to share articles, information or other resources, please use the ""INFORMATION/RESOURCES"" flair on your post, so that those who came to the sub for this purpose can find it easily. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***Fifth:***  Again, **please**, can we avoid any *ad hominem* attacks here? Play the ball, not the man? Be willing to agree to disagree? <newline>  <newline> Most of us have had significant trauma in our lives, and when triggered into strong emotional expression, I see no issue with making clear our feelings about our experiences. However, it’s another thing entirely to respond by attacking someone else’s opinion by calling names, or ascribing motives to them that they have not explicitly stated themselves. That latter response is the kind of “reading another’s mind” bullying that most of us have had enough of in our lives. <newline>  <newline> Speaking of bullying, any attempt to repeatedly target another user or to maliciously cause drama will lead to banning from the sub. <newline>  <newline> This includes taunting another user in order to ""get a rise"" out of them, then ""camouflaging"" further responses as ""concern"" (asking them if they've taken their meds, or telling them to ""chill out"", for example).  That is just pure crazy-making gaslighting - and those of us who have been in abusive relationships recognise the dynamic all too well. <newline>  <newline> Any of you who indulge in this sort of behaviour will not only be banned, but ***I will call you out publicly in the process***. <newline>  <newline> I do this not to be unduly cruel or vindictive, but as an assurance to the rest of the users - especially any who were directly targeted - that I will not countenance such behaviour.  Too many of us have endured sustained and often systemic bullying with no one having our backs, much less advocating for us. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> ***Finally:***  **Let’s have some fun!** I really want this to be a safe space to indulge our innocent weirdness without fear of derision. If people rave about something that doesn’t appeal to you, please don’t stomp on someone else’s joy in the process. *Chacun à son goût*, as they say. <newline>  <newline> If you want to share information about anything that sparks your interest (what I call a ""transient or permanent obsession"", as not all of us have a single, enduring ""special interest""), please do!  As a number of users have discovered here, many of us share those fascinations - to a greater or lesser extent - and we curious autists are always interested in learning more.   And yes - that includes ""info dumps"", if you're so inclined.   <newline>  <newline> The ""NERD ALERT!"" flair has been created in part for this purpose.  Please feel free to flag your nerdiness!   <newline>  <newline> And if you see some fun examples of old broads being weird - or just something that tickles your fancy that you think might speak to us - please share them with us as well.

328;132a6ob;Exploring Diagnosis...Help! Lol;Hi folks! I literally joined Reddit for this haha. I've (34) recently begun wondering seriously if I may be on the autism spectrum and doing some personal research. My mom thinks I am based on vague impressions from media, and I see potential based on some casual internet research and (don't hate me) things I've seen from creators on Instagram.  <newline>  <newline> I have ADHD, which makes me doubt ASD as a diagnosis since there is so much symptom overlap in a lot of domains. I have an intake appointment with a local psych who specializes in autism and ocd, but I know she uses ADOS 2, which I've heard doesn't catch adults or females as well as it should. I have good social skills once I warm up, or for brief or professional interactions, so either I'm great at masking or it's a sign I don't have ASD. Either way, I worry it will interfere with diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> I've taken the RAADS-R, AQ, and EQ and score at or above the threshold for ASD on all three. These seem to be well liked and researched by the community as far as I've seen, but idk if my psych will care. She is a woman, so maybe she'll be more open to female presentation, idk.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I'm hesitant to self dx because I don't want to appropriate (for lack of a better word) the ASD community or identity, and also because I think a formal dx will make me personally feel validated.  <newline>  <newline> Do you all think it's worth trying for a dx? What has your experience been, especially if you present atypically or need low support?  <newline>  <newline> Thanks in advance!;DefiningAri;False;1;1.0;2023-04-28 21:21:52;/r/aspergirls/comments/132a6ob/exploring_diagnosishelp_lol/;aspergirls
329;12ztv2c;So glad it turned out better than expected;I hope I did this right and the thumbnail is the upright pizza! <newline>  <newline> A heads up for a long read: <newline>  <newline> Y’all know that TikTok duet/stitch trend where an autistic woman ask how the 30ish% of people with ASD have jobs? I’ve been holding back on being on social media after a traumatic event last year where I deleted my 19 year old facebook account and still feel compelled to make my TT account public to say, “WITH INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTY especially if you are a woman or woman of color!” <newline>  <newline> Friday I went through a traumatic experience when trying to do the right thing at work. It’s not the first time a traumatic event from unprompted pervasive bullying and/or harassment in the workplace left me with acute PTSD, trying to put the pieces of myself back together. Only difference this time is I know I’m autistic and have a (massively misunderstood/under diagnosed/under researched) justification for why my body responds the way it does to egregiously uncomfortable and objectively undeserved social interactions, knowing underneath every belittling dehumanizing comment, NTs subconsciously believe I’m at the bottom of social hierarchy because of how I look and that behavior is universally acceptable. <newline>  <newline> I’m posting here because it’s not common knowledge the ties between bullying/harassment related trauma on folks with ASD, nor how devastating it can be for us so that yes, we can experience physical reactions akin to that of being in active duty combat, because someone unnecessarily called us stupid in what we’re told to believe is a “professional” environment because they felt insulted by our mere presence. <newline>  <newline> How can that be? I don’t know, but I have in writing an example of just that from 5 days ago, leading to my current state of complete disfunction and debilitating physical and emotional pain. <newline>  <newline> All this to say, this post is for you. If you can identify with any of the above even in the slightest, I hope you can understand the positivity I am trying to share as I continue. <newline>  <newline> So, yet again at 34, I am on the path of recovery seriously considering if I can ever work again, but with the advantage of treatment for my ADHD, a therapist and psychiatrist, a _very_ good job that has allowed me to take 4 weeks fully paid leave and I was ready to breakdown again because I saw my $47 pizza delivery that I was hoping would feed me for 2 days that I ordered at 6:45pm and waited an hour and a half for because it took me 3 days to figure out what I could eat, standing on its side. <newline>  <newline> Then I opened it and remembered that sometimes we set a goal with specific expectations and somethings just look much worse than they turn out to be, and may offer more than you initially anticipated.  <newline>  <newline> This is like 4 days at my current appetite, and I know I’ll make it. You will too. <newline>  <newline> I have hella free time these next few weeks and if you’re an outward processor like me, I could def use some conversations with folks who can relate. I’m more than happy to share what tips and tricks have helped me so far and/or be an understanding ear. I wouldn’t have made it this far if no one had done the same for me, so I can even think to try and be here for you.;mellabarbarella;False;10;0.93;2023-04-26 18:45:00;/r/aspergirls/comments/12ztv2c/so_glad_it_turned_out_better_than_expected/;aspergirls

331;12zrr7w;Being autistic and manipulative?;So my now ex broke up with me recently, (them 27m ADHD and myself 26f AuDHD) and with them not feeling happy, saying they wanted to work on themselves, they also mentioned there was possible manipulation.  <newline>  <newline> Has anyone else ever been told this? Or know how to catch it before you do it if you have or know you can be that way? I recently read a Quora post about it, but it didn't make sense to me. It did however, had me thinking back to times where I possibly could've been manipulative. But I still don't fully understand.  <newline>  <newline> Any help or input is appreciated. <newline>  <newline> **EDIT**: So we had a talk today when we exchanged our things. And turns out that he took most of what is my autistic tendencies as manipulative. Examples would be if things didn't go how I wanted, my mood would shift. He felt he was on eggshells because the littlest things sometimes did set me off, but not always in a super negative way. But also with further explanation he also now knows (and did know in some of the moments where I said I wasn't actually angry) that in the moments he explained I wasn't trying to come off angry. Other things he mentioned was that there were times I overstepped the line when I would say things and again, over discussion was understood that it's just due to that I often don't know if what I'm saying is the right thing. On top of other things it was a learning discussion for both of us. No true blame was being put on me and he helped me understand that. But he's going through things as well, and we truly didn't know each other well enough, so in the end it just wasn't going to work. We're still remaining friends though, and I'm thankful for that.;SimpForGhostieFace;False;32;0.95;2023-04-26 17:51:38;/r/aspergirls/comments/12zrr7w/being_autistic_and_manipulative/;aspergirls

335;12sv0lg;Hoping that someone will read my story about an autistic girl (chipmunk) in school.;   <newline>  <newline> Hello other autistic people, I hope this is the right place to post my request. I am a 71-year-old woman. About five years ago, I figured out that I am autistic. I could hardly believe it, so I got an official diagnosis. But I already knew.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve had passionate interests in one artistic endeavor after another, each of which I pursued until I’d done it to death. One special interest was writing a children’s reader about life in elementary school. It follows a group of rodents, the hero of whom is the Red Rat. (The species choice doesn’t appeal to many people initially, but I chose it because “I must get rid of the red rat” has so many short vowels. And because I think rats are fine little creatures.)  <newline>  <newline> There are nine volumes, beginning with simple stories and ending with a volume about an autistic chipmunk (although the word *autistic* is not mentioned because rodents don’t use diagnoses).  <newline>  <newline> My problem is that I can't find anyone, much less someone autistic, who is interested in reading the stories. I’d like to know if it’s a passable depiction of life in school as an autistic girl and if it might be helpful to anyone.  <newline>  <newline> I have a PDF that I could give people, but I can't get it onto this post. I'd be happy to post it if someone tells me how. There is also a Youtube video where I read the story aloud. I attached the link to Part 1, but I cannot get the link to Part 2 to attach, so here it is separately: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojVWbvMzCUo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojVWbvMzCUo&t=6s) <newline>  <newline> If anyone could read or listen to the stories, I would be very grateful.

339;12i21m9;What do we think about this?;I recently had a conversation with someone close to me about movie characters and a certain YouTube channel—Cinema Therapy if you wanna know (it’s amazing please check it out if interested). I was relating that the two guys analyzing movies and character dynamics named a couple characters as “probably autistic” or “neurodivergent” (without much elaboration) and how I thought that was interesting. My friend immediately was like “why can’t they just be weird? Why does everyone have to be neurodivergent now? Is everyone on the spectrum/thinks they are on the spectrum?” I don’t think this was a flippant comment or ableist or something, I know it was meant as a valid question.  <newline>  <newline> But yeah, why does it seem like it’s so popular and dare I say trendy to label not even ourselves but just abstract, fictional characters as autistic when that might not be their intended purpose (exceptions would be like Sheldon Cooper where it’s extremely obvious that’s what was meant when they wrote his character). I feel like TikTok has something to do with this and it’s probably beyond the scope of this post to debate the problems with TikTok but I worry it is getting watered down so thst this problem arises where other people not in the community are getting the impression everyone is or everyone thinks they are autistic.

340;12h1ylv;I am trying to save my friendship with my guy friend. Help!;"  <newline>  <newline> I am creating this post under a temporary account so my friends don't see. <newline>  <newline> I have this guy who has been a close friend for about a year and a half and at first I REALLY enjoyed my time with him. We could joke together and talk about gossip and he was/is a really great friend. I found myself spending a lot of time with him when usually I would stay home. He helped me meet people <and he helped me get over my awkwardness talking to them> and he was ND like me. He helped me be more open with my emotions WHICH IS REALLY HARD and I blossomed a lot thanks to him. He would also give me really good advice on guys I had interest in. <newline>  <newline> He is ND too and I felt comfortable to be my self with him without masks, BUT like three months ago just before Christmas he asked me to date. I know his friends had been trying to convince us to date, but I honestly would rather keep him as a friend and he felt the same way too until they convinced him we would be ""perfect together"". He is very impressionable and whatever they told him affected him very deep. When I said no, he was really hurt and he blocked me for two days <which really hurt me> before coming back and apologizing and saying he didn't want to lose me but he was afraid. <newline>  <newline> He has been hurt ever since and insecure and it has been really stressful and hard but I thought ""Eventually our friendship will be back how it was"" although I did like that he told me more things about himself after he came back<Like I didn't even know he spoke French!>. That was really nice to get to know my friend more. <newline>  <newline> But it got so stressful that I had arguments with him and we kept triggering each other and finally he blocked me again and when he came back I told him I was hurt and I didn't think he actually was my friend just another guy trying to get in my pants. I knew that wasn't true and it was my traumatization talking, but I blocked him and that triggered him and he tried to get ahold of me so much I blocked him everywhere even my phone and Pinterest. <newline>  <newline> It has been a month, and I don't know how I feel. I do want my friend back. I care about him. I would spend more time with him than anyone sometimes spending entire days at his house. Our time recently had not been all bad. He is really good at finding things I like to do and we can do frivolous things together like shopping for socks <I collect novelty socks!>. He also doesn't mind going with me over and over to see owls and just talking to me while I draw them and our time together has been really valuable to me. <newline>  <newline> It was easier when he let me just give him time than when he wanted so much time. Somehow it made a difference when I thought I HAD to give him time, even when he said I didn't. I need some time to myself to just sit at home and deflate. <newline>  <newline> He is a really good friend, and he is really burdened sometimes because he overextends himself trying to please people and I liked that I could be a refuge for him. It felt good that my ND self could do that for someone. I don't know how to be friends with him again though. I triggered him when I blocked him and I know he was really hurt. I didn't mean to hurt him I was just overwhelmed. I don't know if blocking him was even the right thing to do, but I needed to do something so I could think. <newline>  <newline> Should I add him again? <newline>  <newline> I want to have a conversation about boundaries because I know from reading here a lot that those are important. He takes these conversations really hard though and I just want him to understand that for a while I want a little distance while he figures out his feelings and we reset. I still also have doubts about if he actually was my friend but when I remember our time together I know there were efforts he made that only a real and true friend could. Our triggers seem to fight each other, but similarly the things about our ND seem to make us match and I like our friendship. <newline>  <newline> I want to save the friendship I think, but I also want to do it in a way that lets me have space and other friendships.

342;12g61fx;Would like some advice: seeking closure regarding high school.;TW for mentions of bullying, parental abuse, SH and suicide. <newline>  <newline> TLDR, I need closure to my secondary school years because of multiple crises and I’m thinking of reaching out to the teachers I was close to because I wanted them to know how much they helped me, but I never had the chance and now it’s been five years and it still makes me feel bad. I don’t know if I should reach out, and facebook is the only way I can do this. <newline>  <newline> This might be a long one, sorry, as it’s been eating away at me for almost two years and I just don’t know who to turn to for advice but in my experience this community has been extremely supportive, and maybe my situation might resonate with some of you.  <newline>  <newline> To cut a long story short, my secondary school career was nothing short of a disaster because I was bullied severely for upwards of ten years (same school from primary through 6th form), my home life wasn’t great because my parents didn’t understand me and physically and emotionally abused me, I had few friends, and as a result of everything I had to endure my marks were poor and I wasn’t the best student. This culminated in a severe mental health crisis and a few suicide attempts, the last of which led to me being suspended and my parents packing me off abroad, where I finished my secondary education, as they felt I wouldn’t be able to reintegrate back into normal school life after pulling a “stunt” like that. <newline>  <newline> I’m doing better now, though: after leaving my old school I was able to pull it together and excel academically, and now I’m in an integrated master’s course at a fairly prestigious university. I still haven’t completely healed from burnout and my mental health is still pretty awful, but it’s not as bad as it once was. <newline>  <newline> For the past few days I’ve just been hyperfixating and stuck in this negative spiral about how that part of my life just feels incomplete, like a wound that heals over a little but tears open again with the slightest movement. I go through long periods of not thinking about secondary school at all, then something jogs my memory and I hyperfixate for the next few weeks. I get this awful pain in my chest. My abrupt departure from my old school and the fact that I technically never had a graduation because of the pandemic didn’t help. I need closure. I’ve tried therapy but I’ve honestly found it unhelpful, and it’s not what I need right now. I know what happened to me wasn’t my fault. I know I did my best to survive. I don’t really care whether my bullies feel remorse or not. By closure I don’t mean I want my bullies to apologise to me or anything. I just need something to help me draw a close to that period of my life, hopefully on a more positive note.  <newline>  <newline> I was thinking of trying to get in touch with a few of the teachers I was close to, actually. Some of my teachers throughout the years have caused me irreparable trauma, but a few of them have actually saved my life or at the very least, did their best to try and help me. I think about them a lot, and I won’t lie, part of me wants to get in touch just to hear an admired authority figure tell me “well done”, which I rarely got to hear back then: it was always “you have so much potential, if only you’d *try*”. I want to prove that I *am* capable of achieving my full potential, and there’s so much I wanted to tell some of my teachers that I never got to say because I left very suddenly, and as time wears on I’m worried they’ll forget me (if they haven’t already) and it’ll be too late. I never even got to say goodbye to some of them and it often makes me feel sad. Also, I just don’t really have friends among my peers from then to reach out to, so the teachers are all I have. <newline>  <newline> I just don’t know if it would be appropriate though, after five years: would it be weird, at this point? They may have already forgotten me, and I don’t know how to cope with that. I suspect one of them definitely remembers me at least a little, but *how* I’d get in touch is also an issue. There’s always Facebook, which I know for a fact the specific people I want to speak to have, but it feels oddly personal and awkward, considering they once taught me. Is it actually inappropriate or am I just overly cautious? I don’t even know how I’d go about it, do I just drop a message saying hello and asking if they remember me? <newline>  <newline> I suppose the advice I’d like is 1) is it appropriate to contact your past teachers for a chat five years after they last saw you: should I do this?? Would they even want to hear from me? And 2) what should I say? I know what I want to *say*, but I have no idea how to start that conversation.;ladymacbethofmtensk;False;3;0.86;2023-04-09 02:23:59;/r/aspergirls/comments/12g61fx/would_like_some_advice_seeking_closure_regarding/;aspergirls

344;129za7x;Coworkers upset you don't share your personal life/details?;"This has been a reoccuring theme at my workplaces. To make it short I like being a private person. I've had bad experiences with people in the past being stalkerish (ex's/ex's families etc). I don't offer up a lot of personal details, also I don't really like talking to most people at work. I do a lot of masking, make pleasantries etc to get through my day. I've noticed that people want to know how old I am. Every job. They will ask and ask and ask. I will make jokes, bat away their questions etc even as far as saying I like to keep that private. AND it pisses some people off. <newline>  <newline> But they won't stop asking, every job, I'm talking 15-20 people (just at my current job!) and I don't come into contact with that many. People speculate whether I'm married/how old I am etc. I had an incident where a guy was mean to me at work/bullied because I wouldn't tell him. (Job years ago) It's annoying. I spoke to an old coworker yesterday who now works at my current job - he said that at our first job together one of the maintenance guys there looked me up and found out how old I was and went around our company telling everyone ""Can you believe she's x years old!!"" And I can literally hear that in my head - the man was a huge gossiper and infact I had a fall out with him because he was gossiping about my trainee and I told him I was having none of that. He told me, because I didn't want to hear the gossip, I could fix my own things and walked off. I was like - OK and I did lol. <newline>  <newline> But, I don't have really any social media except linkedin and I keep my birthday/age hidden. The only way I'm thinking is this guy used some background check or some site to look me up, which may give him some other personal details. It really bothers me. I've had people do this about 4 times before, two of them admitting to it - actually hiring a private detective!! (The other two I'm assuming, they wouldn't tell me exactly how they found where I lived etc) I've had to go no contact with abusive people in my past and have found them on my doorstep, letters in my mail etc from different people. I like my privacy for a reason. <newline>  <newline> It's not like I don't try to talk to coworkers but they don't need to know exactly where I live - I'll say the town or over by x store, but I'm not giving the cross streets etc. They don't need my age or whether I'm married or the details of my relationship. But when you don't then I feel you're deemed standoffish, not part of the team, etc. Like people don't get that everyone doesn't want to share their personal life/details with folks? Anyone experience this? Any advice? Should I craft a fake life to tell people? <newline>  <newline> As well I noticed a coworker - well not direct coworker, but someone at my workplace was following me on tiktok. I removed him from my follower list and made things a bit more private.

348;123xmn6;Had such an awful experience with my doctor and I'm feeling more invalidated than ever.;"I am in my late 20s and after years of wondering if I was just an inherently immature, dumb, lazy, and irritable bitch, I now suspect I am on the spectrum. I used to think it was impossible because I'd only ever seen autism represented in non-verbal children and violent young men, but after lots of research and even following some late-diagnosed autistic women on Instagram, I've been able to find some evidence that fits my situation. I've been working with the same therapist for almost two years who has told me it's entirely possible that I am on the spectrum and referred me for an evaluation. The person she referred me to doesn't take my insurance (yay USA) so I had to research a provider on my own. I did find one, but they needed a referral from my primary care doctor. She is about 70 years old and a well-known doctor in my area. I had a male doctor for most of my life up until 2020 and was interested to see if having a female doctor would be any different. Spoiler alert-- it was different and it was awful.  <newline>  <newline> I went in for an appointment and told her the situation and that I needed a referral to this certain provider for an autism evaluation. She went on to tell me that I didn't look or act autistic and that most people she saw who were autistic wouldn't look her in the eye or let her use her stethoscope on them, and usually had their parents with them. She also said that ""we all deal with social anxiety and interpersonal stress,"" and that we are all ""a little crazy."" She then interrogated me on what I would do if I was diagnosed. I was horribly embarrassed and made up something about learning to accept my true self. She awkwardly shook my hand, got up, and left after telling me she signed the referral as a ""patient request.""   <newline>  <newline> I have little to no support outside of my partner and my therapist for this whole autism thing and this experience at the doctor really squashed me flat. I'm absolutely going to find a new doctor, but I just can't believe people like her are actually practicing and telling people like me this stuff all the time!  <newline>  <newline> I'd be really interested to hear if anyone else had an experience like this and how it all ended up.";pbandpepperjelly;False;14;0.89;2023-03-27 19:31:22;/r/aspergirls/comments/123xmn6/had_such_an_awful_experience_with_my_doctor_and/;aspergirls
349;11z85ig;Basically been told I’m autistic, but now feeling second thoughts about a diagnosis;I’m 20, and have wondered if I have autism for a couple years.  I asked my psychiatrist and doctor but no one could really help.  Eventually my therapist told me she was studying for being able to do an official diagnosis and after months she was able to do it!  So I was super excited to start the assessment, which is a few different meetings.  Before we started I had to sign something acknowledging the possible negative consequences, and I did sign it.  It’s been the three official assessments and in a few weeks she’ll have a report for me.  She’s basically told me she thinks I’m autistic, and based off the answers I gave and what happened during the assessments I’m sure I am as well.  However, now I’m really starting to realize how series the possible negative consequences are, such as in regards to immigration and adoption, especially after I saw this random Twitter post.   I started worrying about this between the second and third assessment but haven’t said anything.  I want the results and the report (I’m curious) and time is running out but I can’t make up my mind!  I don’t have any concrete plans but I want to keep my options open, especially with how pessimistic I am about the future.  There are positives.  There’s simply being able to say I’m diagnosed autistic, but at this point I think I can without feeling like I’m being dishonest.  Accommodations with school and work could come from my ADHD diagnosis.  However, my therapist also talked about work and school programs, which I said I was interested in, but I think I could only use if I get the diagnosis.  I really want to go to college and get some extra cash, but task initiation is really hard, and I was quickly fired from my previous two jobs which are super easy and basic because I didn’t learn fast enough, so I really need help.  But I can’t just pretend possible negatives don’t exist.  Sure, there’s times when I don’t have to disclose a diagnosis, but some people have to, or will be able to find out.  It’s definitely not an option right now but what if I want to adopt a kid…?  There’s a lot of variables to that, but it’s a possibility it will happen some day.  Autism doesn’t prevent me from adopting but it could be a barrier, even if I’m in a better place then.

351;11vm95p;sensory overload from trying contacts for the first time;Like a good adult, I finally went to the eye doctor yesterday for the first time since pre-pandemic 2020. I'm 27, and I decided I would finally try contacts.  <newline>  <newline> I've always been terrified. Can't stand to even see my wife take contacts in and out. But I was like, I'm an adult! I'm brave! I can handle contacts!  <newline>  <newline> Part of the reason I want contacts is because I don't really fancy the sensation of wearing glasses, either. I don't like feeling the weight on my face, and it makes my ears sore. It slips down and I constantly have to push it up etc etc. Especially at work, I also have to wear a headset and the sensation of the glasses + headset is a lottttttt.  <newline>  <newline> So I decided to try contacts. They gave me testers yesterday to see if I like them. I got them in, they took a little while but I got them in without too much grief.  <newline>  <newline> The guide thing said to wear it 3 hours the first day. So at the 3 hour I'm trying to get my contacts out.  I start with my right eye. I'm having a lot of trouble. Like I'm touching my eyeball and doing the correct thing but the contact just wasn't doing anything.  <newline>  <newline> My wife was telling me I have to touch it harder and firmer to grasp it.  <newline>  <newline> I started having a meltdown after like the tenth try. Like one of the worst meltdowns I've ever had, at least the worst sensory meltdown. I honestly felt like a kid who couldn't handle getting a splinter out or something. And I'm 26.  <newline>  <newline> I was just sobbing and hyperv3ntilating and flapping my arms and like melting down and slumping down to the floor and everything. Like I felt trapped? By my eyeballs? The thought that I *had* to touch it *harder* amd the thought that I'm already touching it as much as I can was too much. And it would be even worse for someone else to touch it! This went on for like an hour and a half with me trying to remove it, melting down, watching YouTube videos, etc. I felt like a fucking failure. <newline>  <newline> Finally my wife is like let's try the left eye because the right one is red now. My goal originally was to have only one bad eye if I had to keep fucking with it 😤 so I had left my left eye alone.  <newline>  <newline> With my left eye I got it out after a few tries with one of the other youtube methods....but my right eye was still not working!!!!  <newline>  <newline> Finally I look down in the sink and my contact had fallen in and stuck towards the top of the sink. My guess is it must have popped out and fell when I was first trying to remove it and didn't notice it. FML  <newline>  <newline> TLDR I just had the worst sensory meltdown of my life and then realized it was for NOTHING. And I now have an irritated eye that I fucked with for NOTHING. and now I don't even know if it would have been nearly as awful of a sensory experience if I had noticed when it fell.

357;11msztf;Frustration (long read);"  <newline>  <newline> I (female) have wanted to get a diagnosis for a while so mentioned it to my doctor. She told me to fill out a questionnaire and make a list of symptoms so she could discuss it with me the next time. Today she called me back and asked why I hadn't filled out the questionnaire and handed it back to the practice. I was very confused because while I did remember her mentioning a questionnaire, I assumed she would go over it with me on the phone. As usual, I misunderstood what someone meant which meant I had to reschedule my phone appointment. Great evidence of autism but not great for much else. <newline>  <newline> So I went to the practice to pick up the questionnaire and when I looked at it I couldn't believe how short it was. Most of you in the UK have probably had to fill it out too. It was ten questions and you had to tick where you agreed or disagreed (mildly or strongly) with the statements. It infuriated me, not only because the doctor could have gone through it with me on the phone but also because the questions were so broad and hard to understand. Some questions were easy like ""I often notice small sounds when others do not."" That one is an obvious: ""strongly agree."" But the rest were not so easy. What does it really mean to be a ""big picture"" person vs a ""detail-oriented"" person? Not only that, but most of the questions were formulated as follows: ""I experience x when others do not."" Now please tell me how I am meant to know what other people experience? How do I know if I can read people ""correctly"" when no one ever tells me exactly how they feel? How the hell can I ""work out what other people are thinking"" by their facial expressions?! <newline>  <newline> Maybe this just confirms that I am autistic because I cannot give straightforward answers to these questions but I really feel this way of assessing people is all wrong. It's bureaucratic. It's a one-size-fits-all approach. I'm especially made because I know these kinds of questions are more tailored to males than females. I also believe that many neurotypical people would also struggle to answer these questions accurately because there is no part where you can ""justify your answer."" I could say that I believe I'm good at reading facial expressions because I've never been told otherwise and this makes me believe I must be doing alright. A neurotypical person could say likewise. <newline>  <newline> I calculated my score and in the end I scored 7 out of 10, high enough to be referred for a diagnosis. I purposefully didn't cheat on the test by reading how to get a high score, despite worrying that I might not ""pass"" (ironic, I know). I repeatedly score high on the apsie quiz (which is far more comprehensive) and definitely relate to a lot of female autistic Youtubers. And I had written loads of notes about things I experienced in childhood that would definitely be more helpful to someone wondering if I am autistic. I'm just very frustrated at the way we adults have to go about getting a diagnosis. It doesn't feel very intuitive. <newline>  <newline> Can anyone else relate to feeling frustrated at the bureaucracy prohibiting us from receiving help/a diagnosis?

358;11kzjzd;failed friendships with NT women;"There have been a couple of vivid incidents where my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness have caused problems in my friendships.  <newline>  <newline> For example, I turned down an invitation to a weekday ladies' night from a friend (lets call her Penny) who was possibly landing a full job at a media agency she interned at for a few months. I struggled to celebrate her accomplishments without feeling waves of resentment and discouragement, which made me feel guilty. I gave Penny some context to why I had my reservations (don't remember what I said exactly, along the lines of experiencing a lot of family issues which held be back in life). She thanked me for opening up and also explained that it was ""easier"" for the company to keep her and ease her into the role than hire someone more qualified but on LOWER pay. We didn't know each other for long at that point although she told me in her exact words that she liked me enough as a friend to want me to be part of her achievement. A part of me felt guilty for being quick to make a snap judgment based on what was expressed externally. <newline>  <newline> Another example was when an ex-friend, *Serena changed her Facebook profile picture of her law degree graduation photo. I couldn't bring myself to congratulate her because of my own struggles with internships, post-college preparation, blurred boundaries with family, and being in a new country. Our friendship started when I got involved with a guy from our rival school whom I met on Tumblr.  It was a very gradual build-up of him unvieling his true colors although I'll spare the details of that for now. I experienced conflicting emotions in my friendship with *Serena as once we pursued our respective degrees, we formed our own groups of friends and found that the people in our new circles shared more similarities with each of us individually than we ever did as a pair. While she taught me the value of genuine friendship, she started avoiding me as our goals and personalities diverged. I also know at the back of her mind that part of it was her not feeling supported as much as she was supportive of me. <newline>  <newline> As I get older, it becomes harder to justify my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness, which can come across as uncaring and insensitive. I know that society expects women to possess maturity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and social awareness, but as someone with a different neurotype, I struggle to meet these expectations. Sometimes, I really don't know how to handle it, or I am fighting my own demons behind closed doors, or it's a combination of the two.";East_Midnight2812;False;10;0.94;2023-03-07 13:37:08;/r/aspergirls/comments/11kzjzd/failed_friendships_with_nt_women/;aspergirls
359;11kcrtk;After getting diagnosed with ASD and learning the signs of autism, I think my mother is also autistic;Hi! I’m a recently diagnosed aspie and this is my first post on the sub. <newline>  <newline> Getting my diagnosis was a peculiar journey. I first started seeing a therapist about my depression 3 years ago, and while she was very helpful in that regard (I desperately needed to talk to someone and I felt so good after the first session that I could laugh for the first time in months), she quickly noticed that I wasn’t exactly good with some types of communication. I told her about the fact that I always felt left out of conversations, like everyone else was communicating through a whole other layer of subtext which I wasn’t getting. That I would sometimes make remarks which people considered rude, but I didn’t understand why. For example, a friend of mine once showed me a picture of the guy she had been seeing, and I said “This one looks nicer than the last 3,” and she got really offended but I did not for the life of me think I had done anything wrong. Up until then she had shown me 3 other guys throughout the time we had known each other, and I was just stating an opinion! Anyways, this whole thing made me feel lonely and I thought that everyone must dislike me and be doing it on purpose to exclude me from conversations. My therapist asked me if I knew what the autism spectrum is and I immediately shut her down. I had just accepted the fact that I had depression and I was NOT ready to mentally ruminate on another thing. I said there was no way I could have autism and she didn’t push it. <newline>  <newline> Eventually, one year in, I made friends with a group of people on Discord. One time, me and two other people who had told me that they are autistic (also aspies) were chatting in a voice call. There was a guy and a girl, and the girl started talking about 19th century European fashion, which is also a topic I am REALLY into. She apologized for rambling about it too much and said it’s one of her special interests. And so the conversation turned to autism, and their funny stories about social mishaps hit a bit too close to home.  <newline> I looked up what the symptoms of autism are and started asking my friends, sisters, even my ex girlfriend if those things describe me well. Literally ALL OF THEM said yes. My best friend even said that he always suspected I was on the spectrum, but thought that since he isn’t an expert it wasn’t his place to pass judgement. <newline>  <newline> There was someone who did not react this way though. My mother. <newline>  <newline> Telling her about my neurodivergent experiences, she just said that everything I had told her was “completely normal”. Like, yeah, “normal” is a very arbitrary term in meaning but she insisted that she also has trouble with understanding body language, irony and sarcasm etc. and that doesn’t make someone autistic. Which, sure, but what she failed to mention about herself was the fact that she has lots of emotional meltdowns, is really lacking in empathy and is constantly stressed in social situations. I, as politely as possible (and I KNOW I was polite this time because I made great efforts to think twice about every word that came out of my mouth), pointed those facts out to her, but she outright denied them and got upset and oddly defensive. <newline>  <newline> Soon after that I approached my therapist about the issue again and in two months I had my diagnosis: high-functioning autism, formerly called… ya guessed it, Asperger’s Syndrome. My therapist also told me that ASD has been shown to run in the family, so to say, and an autistic person may be more likely to have a child who is also on the spectrum. So yeah, fun stuff. <newline>  <newline> Can anyone else relate to this situation? Figuring out signs of autism in family members after finding out about one’s own autism? <newline>  <newline> I might post more on how the diagnosis has changed my approach to life if I feel like it.

362;11cirz3;Does anyone else find that making friends is a numbers game?;I feel like you guys might get this. I feel like it's easier for neurotypical people to get along with a greater percentage of the people they meet, so maybe it's not the same for them, but I've always found in my life that friendship is a numbers game. I have met, and tried to become friends with, many, many people over the course of my life. I didn't realize I was autistic until relatively recently and was only formally diagnosed even more recently, so I didn't know that was part of the issue. I just thought I needed to try harder, and even though I am rather introverted, I spent a lot of time experimenting and trying on different friend groups. Some fell flat pretty much instantly, like in the first hour or so I realized that I had nothing in common with these people and didn't know how to relate to them at all. And some lasted longer, but eventually fizzled out. And some have morphed into the friendships that I have today. But not for a lack of trying. <newline>  <newline> I mean, it hasn't been particularly easy, and I know there are people who have gone through the same process as I have and still have not met their people. But I also wonder if, for us, it's just more effort on average, and so as a result, we need to meet a greater number of people than a neurotypical person might. But also, that this reality is often not recognized or acknowledged, so sometimes we meet a few people, don't click with them, and then give up rather than continuing trying. <newline>  <newline> Also, I feel like neurotypical advice isn't very useful for us. Like for example, people often say to go to hobby groups or meetups or whatever. But I find there's no clear path to making friends through that. I feel like neurotypical people understand intuitively that in order to make friends out of these types of groups, you need to attend regularly and that eventually a friendship might spring up, but it's not an automatic thing. I eventually figured that out, but I also find it's generally not really worth it for me. Also, if most of the people there are neurotypical, for me, at least it's a losing proposition from the get-go. Try as I might, I can't get along with most neurotypical people. We just have nothing in common. Even if we might have an interest in common, the way we interact and what we expect of those interactions is so different that it just doesn't work. <newline>  <newline> Another way of meeting friends could also be through work, volunteering, or even online. I've met a lot of my friends through forums, Twitter, or Discord, and eventually met them in real life. I feel like this is a very effective way to meet people for neurodivergent people, but it's often not recognized or shared. <newline>  <newline> Thoughts?;turnontheignition;False;4;0.91;2023-02-26 14:38:35;/r/aspergirls/comments/11cirz3/does_anyone_else_find_that_making_friends_is_a/;aspergirls

364;11akx9z;Reading about the “over diagnosis of autism” and questioning whether I should proceed with an evaluation;After reading Unmasking Autism, going through a really stressful phase of life, and struggling more than usual with sensory sensitivities and self injurious behavior during meltdown like episodes brought on by sensory overwhelm and emotional stress… I decided to schedule an autism assessment with a psychologist who has experience working with adults, specifically AFAB people.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve got a long list or reasons why I think I may be Autistic, but I’ve been so worried about “faking” or trying to find an “excuse” for my behaviors and shortcomings in life. I’m constantly researching autism and trying to decide if the assessment is really worth the money… I’ve just wandered across [this article](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.13296) and am now feeling 1. Very silly for even thinking I might be autistic and 2. Like I’m hopping on a “being autistic is cool now” trend.  <newline>  <newline> My “should I be evaluated??” story: <newline>  <newline> My younger brother was diagnosed with Autism when he was 3: he has ASD level 3 and he has faced a lot of hard challenges in life. My mom knew that my brother was different and had challenges from a very young age. I, on the other hand, met all developmental milestones and while I’ve really struggled with social situations, overwhelming emotions and meltdown-like episodes when things are too much, and navigating adult life, it’s been an easy ride for me when I compare myself to my brother. <newline>  <newline> But, I’ve read about masking, how some people are “undetected” in childhood, and thought, Autism seems to fit my experience. I have so much in common with the diagnosed female autistics I see on YouTube and I see that many professionals think it entirely possible for a women to be undiagnosed as a child and still be quite validly diagnosed as an adult. I thought, “Okay, I’m really privileged to be able to access an evaluation. I want to do it.” <newline>  <newline> But the more I read from people who say that the diagnostic criteria is being stretched too far, the more i worry that I’m hopping on some sort of “everyone is autistic now” trend. <newline>  <newline> Ugh.

365;118eu2n;My new counselor recognized my ASD traits and it was validating.;  <newline>  <newline> I've been seeing counselors that  aren't a good fit, but today I saw one that recognized my ASD traits.  I'm not just sharing this is a victory but maybe what she said can help  you too: <newline>  <newline> She said that the reason  why I might be struggling to support myself is because I've had the  wrong diagnoses. She also said that a person with social anxiety is  going to approach social situations differently than someone with ASD. I  guess that's obvious, but I always considered myself to have Social  Anxiety Disorder, which has been in my mental health charts for years. <newline>  <newline> Recently,  it was also suggested that I could be bipolar. But after talking to my  counselor today, she told me that she knows some things about adult,  Autistic women and that I remind her very much of someone whose podcast  she listens to! <newline>  <newline> I told her how my  mom keeps trying to be nice but ultimately refuses to believe I'm  Autistic. I had Occupational Therapy offered to me in elementary school  but because of my parents' denial, I didn't get help. My mom says  everyone struggles with these things and that if I was Autistic I'd be  like the stereotype of mute young boys who stare off into space and  don't speak. <newline>  <newline> My counselor said  it's better not to even tell people that we are Autistic if they can't  be supportive. It just sucks because I have no one in my life to talk  about this with. She gave me the name of someone to follow on Instagram  named Morgan Harper Nichols who wrote a book recently. Has anyone here  heard of her? <newline>  <newline> She asked me if I  really wanted to work around people out of the house and I admitted that  no, I do not. But then she asked if I really hate people and I also  said no, I do not. She said it sounds like it's just too overstimulating  and stressful to try to be social at work and that's it's an  unnecessary stressor for me. I was surprised she said this because most  people try to get me to overcome the anxiety or ignore it, but she was  agreeing with me that maybe my work should be solo and I could get my  social needs met in a structured, group setting like a class. I was so  happy that she said that! <newline>  <newline> The  problem is, I can't find work from home.

370;112q6e2;Valentine's Day as a late-diagnosed autistic.;I used to like Valentine’s Day as a kid because I would get candy and valentines from everyone and wouldn’t feel alienated(like in elementary school). However, in 6th grade, we got candy grams delivered from friends and partners and most of the girls got them, but I didn’t get one and felt horrible. I actually cried, and I was more hurt that no one thought of me romantically than I thought. I got some essence of solace from others, but I would actually get made fun of for being single since then. (Like I was called desperate because I would read romance novels, yeah I like it but mainly for the story, honestly, I got self-conscious about reading romance novels in general until TikTok made it popular.) Also just not having a boyfriend, in general, would also make me feel self-conscious and bullied by my looks and everything else.  And I made this promise I would have a valentine that would be for me, and people would also respect me. <newline>  <newline> So during senior year, I did have a boyfriend but he and I wasn’t a match at all, I did like someone but it was so tiresome to like them I didn’t know what to do at that point(I did tell him, but he was ambivalent with his answer), I was even recovering from middle school in general of being bullied by a guy who liked me, and I was just really depressed. I soon remember I cried in class, and it was distressing. I never cried like that before in my life, because I was honestly more devastated and scared because I was single, but I didn’t have anyone to belong to. Even if it was once or twice or even a stable group of friends to lean on. Plus I was mostly scared, because think about it, you never had a valentine who was yours, and finally, you're going to be an adult which is arguably better, but it’s less predictable than having a valentine that you know of since public school. And it was the feeling of the other kids were right, I will be lonely and be single, I was more scared of having that fate than sad. I even wanted to have Valentine's Day be almost abolished, not because I am single but more of why celebrate that with your partner when you have 364 days a year, and why have a day that triggers others like me who are neurodivergent, or not fit in the confines of being a datable match. (I still do, but more of a reformation of what the holiday should be) <newline>  <newline> Now at this point, I did have Valentine's Day that I was taken, but that was an insane story, and since I am single I actually made this promise that every Valentine's Day I get a tattoo(I have one, and it's a bittersweet story) or I do something nice for myself. And since being diagnosed I actually am starting to like myself more because I know about my condition, and honestly, it’s that kids are evil, and I was misunderstood.  <newline>  <newline>  I do however wish that the philosophy of Valentine's Day was different from before because of people like us who don’t fit into the mold of being datable(whether physically disabled, dealing with a mental illness, or neurodivergent). Or better, you’re fine being single, especially if you lived in an abusive setting, are a late bloomer, or are people who are ace/aro(YOU FUCKING VALID TO ME!). Besides I think my biggest trigger for Valentine's Day is the feeling you’ll never be loved, something is wrong with you being who you are(especially who are on the spectrum), and a holiday that is so advertised that you are single and alone. Besides Valentine's Day, I would argue is more isolating than any holiday that I've encountered, and I have to deal with Christmas every year. Besides, what we all want is a happy ending with our new beginning. Or a new chapter to start to be happy with ourselves.  <newline>  <newline> Do you believe that Valentine's Day should be more communal(like being able to be single after abuse, being a late bloomer, or being celebrated by who you are) or not be celebrated at all?;LeviathanNypmh;False;1;0.83;2023-02-15 05:12:36;/r/aspergirls/comments/112q6e2/valentines_day_as_a_latediagnosed_autistic/;aspergirls

375;10tw04j;I've been feeling super depressed and disheartened regarding my social situation. How can I help myself from here?;Firstly I'd like to apologise for such a long post!!!  <newline>  <newline> I(31F) moved to a bigger city when I was 25 with my boyfriend of 7 years. It started out great as his friend's lived there too and for 1.5 years we socialised regularly and I really felt a sense of belonging in a good group of people. Prior to this I always struggled in social situations as I was bullied all throughout my schooling years and as an adult I tended to withdraw. I am told that I am a really 'likeable' person and that I come off as being confident and am super friendly, but behind all of this I always feel like that 'weird', maladjusted kid/teen who was taunted everyday at school. <newline>  <newline> For the last 5 years I have been trying so hard to establish a good group of friends as I really lost that after my break up as the group kinda fell apart once we broke up and all these people lost interest in keeping in touch with me, even though I ended my relationship on good terms with my ex. I have come close to making good friends individually (which I fare better at), but these people have moved overseas or interstate. I also made the most amazing best friend during the pandemic and sadly she passed away quite tragically in 2021. I am always putting myself out there by joining countless hobby/meet up groups, friendship speed dating, socialising with colleagues outside work, going to gigs/events alone, going to 'supper clubs' in my city, using bumble bff and I even recently got so desperate that I started a tinder account, set it to women/non-binary and specifically communicated in my bio that I am using the app to meet new friends, not to date. I also work part-time in a very social work environment and study full time at an architecture school where I'm constantly meeting new people. <newline>  <newline> Unfortunately over the last 5 years nothing has really materialised into a successful group of friends. The most I have gotten is my best friend who passed away (which I'm not discounting as this was a total blessing to me in my life) and individual connections with women who were total flakes or that evolved into friendships where the women were dominant with me or overtly disrespectful/would put me down. <newline>  <newline> I am down to the following handful of connections and I'm finding them so one-sided that it's really impacting my sense of self worth trying to keep the friendship going, because I don't really feel valued: <newline>  <newline> * Friendship with a girl who was also a best friend with my friend who passed away who I've kept in touch with over the last 2 years. She's a well known music person/DJ in my city and already has lots of friends and I've always gotten the impression that while she likes me, she already has too many friends (I don't like coming to this conclusion, because it's not always accurate). I recently reached out with her and asked her how she was holding up and told her I'd love to get a wine with her. She told me it was so nice to hear from me and said she would love to catch up but then kind of brushed it off when I was trying to make concrete plans. <newline> * Friendship with another girl who was also very close to my friend who passed away. I have always been the one to initiate plans and she has cancelled on me 3 times in a row due to her chronic illness (which I can understand), however never makes an attempt to reschedule. She constantly tells me that she 'loves me' when we speak, so I'm super confused. I want to address this with her, but I feel like it's unwarranted considering her chronic illness. <newline> * Friendship with a couple who I used to hang out with me my ex every weekend in our late teens/early 20s. They moved to my city about 3 years ago and are active in the music scene and have already made heaps of friends through this. I've tried to keep the friendship going with them but they're always 'busy' and when I try to engage with them about the shows they're going/events they're attending they're super vague about it and I feel a bit uncomfortable attending on my own within a pretty unfriendly/cliquey crowd of people (I attended one of their shows alone a few times and it wasn't a pleasant experience). I've always been the one to initiate plans with them and I felt like our last hang out over a dinner was successful, with them saying it was 'great to see me' and that they would love to have me over for a BBQ this summer. It's been months since then and I feel like for the 6th time in a row I am the one having to initiate our next hang out. I recently went on a date with a guy who was mutual friends with them and I was super disheartened to hear him tell me he hangs out with them regularly. <newline> * My close friend who I made in 2018 recently moved interstate temporarily keeps leaving me on read when I try to organise a time to have a video call/phone chat (I've tried 3 times now( and I'm beginning to feel resentful. I have been considering addressing this with her, but she's a super defensive person and I feel she will push me away if I try and tell her how I'm feeling. <newline> * A friend I made last year moved also moved interstate temporarily. I reached out to send her a cute video (we were sending these together frequently throughout our friendship) and I told her that I hope she's well and I missed her. She left me on read. <newline> * A guy at work who I get along so well with, but every time I try to initiate plans he's always 'busy'. <newline> * I made sort of an internet friend with a girl who lives in my part of town through Instagram. She was regularly chatting with me liking my stories/content and I recently told her that I think we should be friends. She told me she agrees and already considers me a close friend. Out of nowhere she went all cold with me and stopped interacting with me altogether. I sent her an instagram message wishing her happy birthday and she hearted my message without any response and I haven't heard from her since/had her look at any of my stories. <newline> * Girl who I met through one of my friends who moved interstate - she has messaged me a number of times trying to make plans and when I reply she just leaves me on read for ages. When I try and pick up the conversation and initiate plans she does it again. I kinda hit my last straw recently as she invited me to a NYE party and on the day I messaged for the address and she left me on read, so I obviously wasnt able to attend and I haven't heard from her since. <newline> * The only 1 friend who is consistent and doesn't flake and shows interest in me - Unfortunately she never wants to go out and only wants to stay at home and smoke weed. I've tried to get her out of the house and do things, but she rejects my offers. She's also super domineering with me, talks over me constantly and makes some pretty unpleasant backhanded comments to me. I've been tolerating this because I feel pretty desperate and she's the only person I have who shows up for me. I have had to be pretty assertive with her on my occasions, but it doesn't seem to change the dynamic. <newline>  <newline> Deep down I know that I am a good friend and I'm a lot of fun. I know that if I were to meet me I would want to be my friend. But I feel so lost and desperate for social connection and the loneliness and social isolation has not only made me doubt myself/reduced my self-esteem but made me consistently depressed over the last 5 years. I know I am still young, but I worry it is going to get harder for me to establish these friendships because I've found that people in their late 20s/30s are less invested in friendships and tend to me more centred on themselves and settling. <newline>  <newline> I feel like this is the only thing I seem to be addressing in therapy and even my therapist is stumped by people's actions/behaviours. She is about my age and tells me that if it was allowed, she would be my friend and integrate me in her social group because she thinks I'm a great person, but obvuously she cant do that. We regularly try and workshop ideas on creative ways I can meet people and she tells me that I'm doing all the right things. <newline>  <newline> Would you say I should just give up on the current connections I currently have that are just making me feel shit or would it be worthwhile trying to resolve? Also -  Has anyone been in this experience before and come out the other end in a more hopeful situation? I'd love to hear your insights on this :);gg6892;False;4;0.95;2023-02-05 00:28:03;/r/aspergirls/comments/10tw04j/ive_been_feeling_super_depressed_and_disheartened/;aspergirls

379;10popbd;Hating myself & autism right now. How would you explain this to someone??;Short backstory: I’m mid 30’s F and married, have 3 kids. I don’t have any super obvious stems or autistic traits. I got evaluated a couple years ago for autism and the psychologist said I wasn’t, basically because I’m not presenting like an 8 year old boy.  <newline>  <newline> But man I swear I have to be. Apparently I can mask well. I know what’s weird about me and try to hide it.  <newline>  <newline> One of my things is, I get obsessed with certain stuff and just run it into the ground for months. I watched Schitt’s Creek, fell in love, watched it over and over and over and over til I basically had the series memorized. When I was a kid I had a favorite musical that I was in love with- had the entire thing memorized, songs music dance, the whole bit. I watched it over and over for years. I knew everything about it.  <newline>  <newline> I’m kind of assuming this is how it is with all of us. Right?  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I found a new musical movie that I’m in love with. Just last week. And I’m memorizing the songs, learning about the actors, I’ve watched the movie at least 4 times by now (honestly it would probably be more if I could just watch it whenever but I do have a family and responsibilities.) and it’s like if I know that that evening I have time to watch the movie, that’s what I’m wanting to do.  <newline>  <newline> Well, so my husband. He also does not believe I’m autistic. I could tell he’s already questioning why I’m watching this movie so much. He knows about some of my past obsessions but I guess doesn’t realize that’s what this is. Idk. So tonight I go downstairs to watch it again (like I really wish I could watch it somewhere where he wouldn’t know that’s what I’m doing) but he comes downstairs halfway thru, sees I’m watching it again, and gets upset that I chose to do that instead of hang out with him and watch a basketball game which I’ve of course never seen and which would be a brand new experience. Now he’s butt hurt because he sees it as me choosing this mindless movie I’ve already seen, over him.  <newline>  <newline> It just sucks! Because I feel like I have to listen to the songs as much as I can during the day. Watch the occasional YouTube video when I’m alone. And then if I have the opportunity to watch the movie, it almost hurts not to do it.  <newline>  <newline> He told me tonight he’s sorry but it’s just *weird* that I’m doing this. But I know! I agree! But it brings me joy. For whatever reasons.  <newline>  <newline> And honestly if I’d known I was going to become obsessed with it, I never would have watched the movie in the first place.  <newline>  <newline> But yeah. I’m not autistic.  <newline>  <newline> Sometimes I wish I could just be more normal.  <newline>  <newline> Is there a way to explain this to him so it doesn’t sound like I’m crazy, or like I’m making excuses?  <newline>  <newline> Are there articles out there about this or something? I could reference to show I’m not the only person in the world doing this?  <newline>  <newline> Thx for reading, if you’ve made it this far.

381;10k6ufh;Is it ok to ask my NT partner to watch info videos with me?;"Since my diagnosis I've been on the (probably quite typical) quest for knowledge and obsessively researching.

My partner is NT and although he's supportive I know he just doesn't ""get it"" sometimes. It makes me wish he was gaining some of this knowledge too, especially when it comes to things like dealing with meltdowns or how to approach some tasks, things that sometimes crop up when we're together or cause issues. I don't want to just start bombarding him with info all the time but I was wondering about incorporating 10mins/1 short video into our evening routine (we usually watch a couple of episode of a series then some youtube funny or info type stuff)? I think some of it is because it's kind of a special interest and I want to share it with him.  <newline>  <newline> I worry he'll think it's weird and a bit cringey or too planned and therefore not fun.

382;10fhn1o;I am so angry at the system we live in;I try to justify certain things but I don’t know how much longer I can. I am so angry with the system we live in, how they treat people with disabilities. How most people who are there to “help us” don’t even truly understand us. They have an education but they don’t have the lived experience. How true help is so few and far between. How to get certain access you need to spend money you don’t have and even then it is a gamble of if real help is on the other side of your money. How these people with education, masters or doctorate degrees think they better than you, above you. Can treat you less than, can take advantage of you.

I am angry.  <newline>  <newline> I just went through a situation with a psychologist and after discussing it with family and friends and my therapists I can say I have been medical gaslight and down $2000 in the process. I have been made to feel like an annoyance when I have been patient, understanding, calm, and let someone continue to give me the run away for 6 months of my life with bare minimum results when I was told I would have something completely different come out of all of this. I want to say I am shocked, but I am not. I have been going through the system since I was 13. Begging for help, advocating for myself. This is just the first time I spent money in hopes to get the help. I am falling deeper into bitterness, anger, isolation, depression. <newline>  <newline> Even though i have never felt a moment of ease since as young as I can remember, I never remember feeling as much pessimism and anger as I have the last few years and its starting to boil over.

383;10ex5s4;I just can't cope with my stressful life anymore. (20f);So a friend of mine invited me to a birthday party of a friend today. Everything was going well, but then he said me that he would uninvite me to the party because an attendant (a neurotypical trans man who is a member of a prominent queer anarchist organization in my city) would be uncomfortable in my presence and he had some problems with me. Because of that, I had a violent meltdown at a mall, (because social rejection is the thing that triggers me the most), and I lashed out to him (the party attendant) in a Whatsapp audio message saying that what was his problem with me in a very anxious tone. Then his girlfriend said to me in a very aggressive mood in Whatsapp that I touched him without his consent and because of that he interpreted that as violent, and that I was aggressive and violent for lashing out (I only hugged him because I am a person who likes hugging people when greeting them, and when he said no I stopped, and that was 6 or 7 months ago). I said that though I understood his concerns, I don't understand why she or his boyfriend didn't tell me about that earlier, and why did she wait until now to inform me and with another person, not her. <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to have a moment of fun with friends, and forget my financial debt, my economic problems, my dad's abuse and transphobia, and all the stress that comes with that. Why everything goes wrong with me? Am I cursed? Have I done anything wrong? Why people don't understand me nor my autism? Why do people ban me from events because of a FUCKING HUG? Honestly I feel sad and rejected, and I think I repulse people because of my social awkwardness and poor social skills.

Also, I know that this is not the experience of a lot of autistic people, so... <newline>  <newline> So, since I was, I don't know, 20 or so, I've always known a bunch of people. I've had a relatively wide social circle. Only a few close friends, but several people that I can see at events, people who occasionally think of me and invite me to stuff, people I meet through volunteering, through playing games, and so on and so forth. I was big into Pokémon GO several years ago and I met a lot of people through that. <newline>  <newline> I am a relatively upbeat person to begin with and have been described in the past as a social butterfly, although I don't know if that's accurate. I'm quite introverted, but I'm naturally friendly, and combine that with masking and people pleasing (now in recovery from that particular affliction), and I think a lot of people liked the me they saw on the surface level. <newline>  <newline> I have had trouble bringing a lot of those friendships past the surface level, for various reasons, but my biggest troubles were before I knew I was autistic. I think I spent so much time exhausting myself and meeting so many people because I just felt so out of place within the world, and I thought that maybe if I looked hard enough, I would find those people who truly understood me. Several times I began to get closer with somebody only to commit a massive social blunder and not find out until after the fact, when they had decided that they no longer liked me, or that I was a total bitch. Many times, I actually had no idea what I was doing! I didn't know that I was being rude or that you weren't supposed to do certain things. But I let my guard down, and, well, you know the rest. And of course so much of polite society just kind of assumes that you know what you're doing, and they don't bother speaking up or telling you what happened. (And I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I spent so much time learning social skills and picking up on this pattern that I began to do the same. Of course, a lot of that was probably people pleasing and fear of conflict as well.) <newline>  <newline> Anyway, fast forward several years, I now know that I am neurodivergent, and I have been able to make some more genuine connections partially because I know how to tell the people who are important to me what's going on, and I think I feel less of a need to always be going out and meeting new people? I still like meeting new people, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm doing less pushing myself out of my comfort zone now because I have people, and I guess on some level I also know that I know how to find people, because I'm not stumbling around in the dark anymore trying to make friends with everyone and everything because I don't actually know why I struggled in the first place, you know? <newline>  <newline> Anyway, just wondering if anyone else can relate. It kind of sucked growing up, not knowing, in hindsight, because I spent a lot of time thinking that I was the problem and trying to fit in with people that I actually didn't have much in common with. For example, I'm not very girly, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with being girly, but I'm just not, and I spent a long time trying to become more girly because I thought that was what would get me friends, but it never worked, and anyway I couldn't relate to those people otherwise. <newline>  <newline> I think part of it might also be because I am comfortable meeting people online. Things like Bumble BFF have never worked for me, but when I was in university I would sometimes interact with other students on Twitter, who would interact with this one professor that everyone really liked, and also there are a few local Discord groups for my area and they sometimes do meet ups as well. Actually, I think I've met most of my friends online in this way. I find that a lot of them are neurodivergent as well, probably because they struggle to make friends in the physical sphere as well.;variableIdentifier;False;0;0.99;2023-01-17 18:22:08;/r/aspergirls/comments/10ejatk/does_anyone_else_have_a_wide_social_circle/;aspergirls
386;10ca0a2;Having a complete existential meltdown over job automation.;With crypto, meta verse and Twitter all tanking, the current tech bro darling is automated art and writing.  (You might have heard about it… lol.) I’m a professional freelance writer, have been for over 8 years now.  Right now the writing community is blowing up about it on a daily basis.  I just found out yesterday my main client is experimenting with chat bots to write articles.   <newline>  <newline> The reason I’m not posting to an art and writing sub about this is because “AI” (I hesitate to call it that as it’s nowhere near the positronic brain the PR teams want you to believe it is) seems to want to automate everything linguistic-oriented autistics excel at: research, writing and hyper focusing by ourselves in a corner.  I read about “AI” and everyone says it will never replace human-oriented, people-facing jobs.  I’ve never long-term survived a job like that.   <newline>  <newline> I’m not exactly terrified of the future.  I’m perfectly comfortable editing chat bot content if AI can survive the various plagiarism/licensing lawsuits and search engine penalties heading its way.  Making sure a robot isn’t spewing antisemitism might be one of society’s most important jobs going forward.  At any rate, it’s likely the current tech bubble that’s due to burst.   <newline>  <newline> What’s bothering me to the point of stress migraines is this feels like one more attack on my life’s work.  One more way society is telling autistics we’re not wanted or needed.    One more glaring message that if I can’t be constantly social and people-facing, I better get out of the future.   <newline>  <newline> Words of advice and support kindly appreciated.;Astralwolf37;False;9;0.89;2023-01-15 04:03:53;/r/aspergirls/comments/10ca0a2/having_a_complete_existential_meltdown_over_job/;aspergirls
387;10bu1ue;Anybody else worry that they're a narcissist? Or come from a narcissist family?;"I feel like I've always known there is something ""off"" about me, and going back to childhood I was always very quiet and anxious. I'm the quietest one in my family and always overlooked, and I've always thought there is something deeply ""wrong"" with me for it. My family loves extroverts & it's obvious that my mom has a favorite who is not me (she constantly praises my older brother & I notice I try to act like him & get nothing from her), etc... but this is going to maybe sound stupid, but I feel like lately my main source of socializing is from my instagram, and the image I've created on my instagram is very narcissistic. It's like the person I pretend to be online is almost evil in my eyes, I post things bluntly and just say it because I want to get my opinion out there and I feel like I don't care if it sounds bad because I assume people probably hate me anyway. I love fashion & everything I post is very ""me"" centered. And I notice lately that I have a lot of resentment inside towards ""normal"" people. I want so badly to be accepted by people & I always come away feeling misunderstood or looked down on for being ""weird"". If I'm being honest, even finding out I might be autistic is making me feel shame because it means I can't change the things I've always tried to. <newline>  <newline> &nbsp: <newline>  <newline> As I look into narcissist traits/families, I'm realizing I think a lot of my family members are likely narcissists, so it's possible I want so badly to be them that I'm trying to force myself to seem like that. But it's tearing me up inside because it feels unnatural. I feel like society admires narcissists while autistic people are seen as weak, and my family members do not like ""weak"" people. Even if I bring up topics like rape or sexual harassment at work (which I've experienced many times), I feel like I'm told to get over in by family members and then I feel like maybe I just see myself as a victim (which I read is a narcissistic trait). <newline>  <newline> &nbsp: <newline>  <newline> **ADD**: All of these responses are beautiful!

388;10b88bm;Blah, neurodiversity spaces sometimes;So I know how this may come across, and I also know that probably one of the automatic responses is going to be, delete Twitter. I don't really want to delete Twitter, thanks, so that's not a super useful response. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I like to look at neurodiversity content and sometimes talk about it, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm not, like, an expert. This morning I read a fairly long thread and I guess I misinterpreted one of their main points because I basically said, it's a good thread, but I have some questions about this thing you said, because if that's true, then how about this situation? And immediately they said that they had been very careful to be clear about the differences between these two specific things and that I was now spreading misinformation. I looked again and realized where I might have gone wrong, so I said, oh, I'm sorry, I think I see where I went wrong, so I'm going to delete my tweets so that I'm not spreading misinformation. Sorry for the confusion. I deleted them. I was a bit surprised by the bluntness of their reply, admittedly. But that was the very first thing I thought to do, because obviously, incorrect tweets are now gone, you know, problem solved, right? <newline>  <newline> They said I should not delete my tweets, that I should reread the thread to get a better understanding, and that I should apologize again for acting on my ignorance and making untrue statements about the actions of others? They basically came up with a made-up term to refer to me as, to describe my actions, and said that I must do all that to demonstrate that I can adapt to their safe space within 12 hours or they would block me. <newline>  <newline> That's basically the gist of what transpired, without getting too much into it and paraphrasing a fair bit. But I don't really want to post all the exact details, but I'm aware this could still potentially be identified. <newline>  <newline> At this point I blocked their account and took my own account private because I didn't really appreciate that they were applying all these intentions to my actions and insisting I apologize again when I already tried and said I would reread the thread and try to do better. And I told them as such, I was like, I would appreciate if you not call me names. But I didn't see their reply because I had blocked them. <newline>  <newline> But like, I literally made three tweets and immediately deleted them when I saw where I had gone wrong. And I apologize. And they basically wrote like 10 tweets calling me all this stuff and saying that I was trying to spread misinformation and misinterpret their words so that I would spread dangerous misinformation into the world and contradict myself and all this other stuff. I was really upset for several hours and it took me a long time to calm down. It was really overstimulating overwhelming to be involved in this interaction, especially because they're a decently large size account in the neurodiversity space. And now I was concerned that I was going to have other people coming after me. That's something I've seen happen on Twitter as well, that somebody makes an honest mistake and gets dunked on. I talked to friends of mine about it and they said that this other person was unreasonable, that I had good intentions and that I should remember that. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I find that sometimes some of these neurodiversity spaces are difficult and I find that sometimes I struggle with conflict with other neurodivergent people because sometimes people have this view that if they are right about something, they can be as blunt as they want with like no concern for somebody else's feelings. I honestly think that I just made a minor mistake and that they way overreacted. I mean, not everyone may view it that way and that's fine, but I think that even if you're trying to correct someone, unless they are purposefully being malicious, which I don't think I was, you should do your best to respond to them with grace because you don't know what they're going through. Like yeah, we're all autistic but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone's going to be okay with completely blunt communication like that. Like if I had said that to someone and they got upset, I would totally understand. If a friend came to me with this exact same dilemma and showed me the screenshots, I would be saying that this person was totally unreasonable. I basically cried, was distracted from work for several hours, and now I've had a headache and I have so much to do and I'm struggling to get any of it done because my day was just kind of ruined by this. It wasn't even just the fact that it happened, but the fact that they kept quote retweeting me and saying all this stuff. That's not true about me. I do my best to not spread misinformation but I'm wrong sometimes. And that happens, nobody can be 100% perfect all the time, and I don't think I should have to be, like, completely well versed in something to be able to talk about it? Like, isn't being gently corrected sometimes how you learn? <newline>  <newline> Blaaah, I don't know. It makes me a bit nervous to participate in some of these spaces because people call their spaces a safe space for autistic people and then the second you make a tiny mistake, it's clear that it's not a safe space for everyone. I don't want to delete my Twitter because I've met a lot of really great people on there, but it's definitely made me question how safe some of these communities actually are.;turnontheignition;False;11;1.0;2023-01-13 22:55:35;/r/aspergirls/comments/10b88bm/blah_neurodiversity_spaces_sometimes/;aspergirls

390;10935do;Learn better alone??;It's the start of a new college semester for me and I am just now realizing that I learn better when I watch lectures alone in my room. I think it's because the classroom environment is just way too overstimulating.  <newline>  <newline> I'm trying to pay attention but my mind wanders and gets attached to what other people are doing. I am very much a people watcher. I always have been. I observe what other students are doing and figure out things about their personality. But I get too carried away watching them and I also have this feeling in the back of my mind that I am being watched too. It's all too much too handle on top of listening to lecture.  <newline>  <newline> I remember watching a TikTok from someone who has ADHD and they doodled while they listened to lecture cause it helped them focus on listening. I wanted to try this but I couldn't help from wanting to look at everyone else instead. I do have a class that is all online and I watched a recorded lecture and I was able to listen to it just fine! I was in the comfort of my room and played sodoku while listening and I understood everything. <newline>  <newline> Now that I look back on it, it was much easier to understand and do well in classes that were all online due to the pandemic. But when I came back to school, I was wondering why I was expending way more effort to do well. I thought maybe the classes are just harder and it could be that, but the classes I'm taking now aren't supposed to be hard and I still can't concentrate as well. I also know that I have to spend time doing other things like chores that I thankfully didn't have to spend as much time doing at home. There is also the factor that there are sooo many students outside of class as well and just walking around campus is very overstimulating. I also live in the dorms and hearing and seeing so many students all of the time is too much. I didn't know much about autism or ADHD at the time, but now that I'm learning more and more it makes sense to me that the classroom environment (and college campus) is too stimulating.  <newline>  <newline> I want to try for a diagnosis so that perhaps I can get an accomodation that has teachers record lecture so I can watch in my room. (Not sure if this accomodation is even possible) But then I have this shameful feeling that I need to be able to interact with this many people to do well in a job setting. Do you guys think that's true in a sense? <newline>  <newline> TLDR: Found out that classroom setting is too overstimulating and I learn better with lectures I can watch alone in my room.;Haneurie;False;4;0.9;2023-01-11 12:07:54;/r/aspergirls/comments/10935do/learn_better_alone/;aspergirls

394;104parn;Wanting to learn more about autism;Hey everyone, a while ago my psychologist who I've been going to for 2,5 years made me (26F) aware of the fact I most likely am on the spectrum. FYI I'm now waiting to get diagnosed. <newline>  <newline> At first I thought she'd probably be mistaken, but that was only because I knew/know so little about autism. Recently I researched it more and I was mind blown. For the first time ever I felt seen/heard. To prepare myself for the diagnosis process, I wanted to write down how I 'work'. Because I always mask and can come across pretty neurotypical and usually forget important things. So I found this unofficial checklist by Samantha Craft and wrote down every characteristic I have from that list with a short explanation. That document is now 10 pages long since I have most of the traits. I cried happy tears whilst going through Samantha's list, I was flabbergasted reading it and that I basically was reading my own personality. I can't express how that feels, but you probably know it too. I've always felt different and guilty about who I am and wanted to change so much, but I now understand it's mostly accepting who I am and that I am far from the only one 'struggling' with being neurodivergent. I say struggling, because I didn't know about being ND and thus that my efforts to change were most of the times doomed to fail. Because I do not struggle with the fact on most likely being on the spectrum, if only it makes me feel calm knowing after 26 years I finally get to understand myself better. <newline>  <newline> Anyways, I want to learn more about autism. This subreddit is so insightful and have already read many recognisable stories. I was wondering if you have any tips for books/youtube channels/blogs/podcasts/IG accounts whatsoever so I can gain more knowledge?  I've already watched a bit of 'Yo Samdy Sam' and maybe want to buy the book 'Unmasking Autism' by Dr Devon Price.

396;103nog2;Just wanted to share another post-diagnosis revelation;Like a lot of you, I have been described as intimidating, standoffish, and pretentious. It seems that I give off “I’m better than you” vibes based on what many people have told me. I’ve always put a lot of physical effort into appearing more friendly (ex-constantly raising my eyebrows to avoid rbf), but it never seems to work.  <newline>  <newline> Well, I think I’ve figured out at least part of it. I noticed a pattern in myself—any time I learn a new piece of information, I assume that everyone else already knew it and I was just behind on figuring it out. I think this stems from being an undiagnosed autistic child and having those moments when you realize something you do is not normal, and everyone already knew that rule but you.  <newline>  <newline> The thing is, this train of thought still applies to very obscure or hyper-specific information. For example, I considered sharing a song I found on Twitter because I really love it and thought some of my acquaintances might too. I posted it, then immediately took it down because I didn’t want people to judge me for having just discovered that song. The thing is, the song is like heavy metal Visual Kei. VK hasn’t even been mainstream in Japan for like 10+ years, let alone here ever. Or I’ll consider talking about a unique cultural experience living abroad (in a country most Americans can’t even point to on a map), and stop myself because my brain goblin tells me that *obviously* everyone from my part of urban America already knows the cultural intricacies of a rural South Asian village.  <newline>  <newline> Now the brain goblin doesn’t always do this. Other times I have no filter, and begin rambling about these obscure topics as if everyone knows exactly what I’m talking about. I throw in lots of jargon and have that signature autistic superfluous vocabulary. And while this truly comes from a place of insecurity, I think that it comes off as pretentious to NTs because they do not, in fact, have the obscure knowledge base of a very autistic person with a wide range of special interests.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, this has been quite the revelation for me so I thought I would share…… but you guys probably already knew this huh?

400;zzuizz;Just gushing about my new hyperfixation;I've somewhat recently gotten into the game path of titans, which is an open world MMO survival dinosaur sim game. A feature of it is that official mod creators can create their own dinosaurs to insert into the game. I've never done 3D modeling, coding, or sound mixing before but I want to learn because I want to make mods.  <newline>  <newline> I've started with the sound mixing, it's the most readily available to me. I wish there was a community for mixing dinosaur sound effects but there's not, and most sound mixing communities are dedicated to music sound mixing. But I'm having so much fun learning about animals by researching their sounds, I love animals so much and I've learned a lot of new cool facts. I've heard animal sounds I've never heard before, I've discovered animals I've never known existed before. I'm a huge perfectionist so I feel so satisfied when comparing my sound collections to others on youtube, or when comparing my dinosaur sounds to others on youtube. I'm discovering so much about the art of dinosaur sound mixing. It's so amazing to give life to creatures long dead. This new hobby gets me working so much with learning both extinct and extant animal facts which are my loves in life. I feel so engaged and full of energy for this. I have barely touched my phone for days I've just been buried to the neck in animal sounds. There's hobbies I've wanted to pursue but never could because they were too expensive and supplies would take up space I just don't have, but sound mixing, 3D modeling, and coding are free and they only take up as much space as a computer and monitor do. I'm very happy I've fallen into this new hobby. I just wish there was a dinosaur sound mixing community out there so I could discuss it in depth with others. Oh to love the strange and niche.

406;zmmc02;So overwhelmed and irritable about makeup and clothes;Hi everyone, I'm F17. I hope it's okay for me to post here because I don't have a diagnosis yet, I'm not self diagnosing at all but it has been in the back of my mind that I might be somewhere on the spectrum. I have talked to my therapist and psychologist about this, and I was scheduled to go get tested about a year ago. It got canceled because of a covid flare-up and then never got rescheduled. Anyways, I'm kind of specifically looking for input from people who are on the spectrum and also struggle with their gender identity.  <newline>  <newline> Basically, I have a really weird relationship with makeup and feminine clothes and things like that. It's like, I'll want to do my makeup and dress like pretty or whatever, but when I go to do it, it feels absolutely awful to me. I'll spend hours like saving stuff to pinterest boards or going out and buying beauty products and clothes. It'll be good in theory, basically, is what I'm trying to say. Another thing is that I do have a past of experiencing gender dysphoria, kind of in waves of different intensity since I was about 12.  <newline>  <newline> Recently, I've been in a pretty long bout (like about 4 months) of really hardly wearing makeup or dressing feminine. So this morning before school, I decided I was just going to try to do some light makeup and wear like a nice outfit. And it went awfully. I felt so uncomfortable in the shirt (it wasn't tight or itchy or anything, just didn't feel right), and the second I applied like a little bit of mascara I started getting just so unreasonably mad and frustrated. I ended up just like wiping it off furiously and throwing on a t shirt. But this is just so frustrating. Why do I feel like this? I really can't tell if this is dysphoria or maybe just a further sign that I could have some sort of autism? I just hate feeling like this. It's just so overwhelming and frustrating when I try to be feminine. I know I could just stop trying to be feminine, and I probably will, but I just want input on if anyone else has this experience and what they think it is. Thanks in advance.;shaniac37;False;9;1.0;2022-12-15 14:25:51;/r/aspergirls/comments/zmmc02/so_overwhelmed_and_irritable_about_makeup_and/;aspergirls

408;zm00cv;How do I learn to dress less childish?;TL:DR What are some YouTube channels, blogs, Pinterest boards, Instagram/Tik Tok accounts, and other forms of media that you use to find trendy, chic, and elegant/“luxurious” clothing?

I also used to wear really tight and cropped outfits. I also wear charms on my face with my makeup. I feel like I’m stuck at 17, and want to make modifications to my wardrobe, while still wearing pastels. I feel like there’s a stereotype where Autistic women are perceived as younger/less mature. I’m rigid in what I like, but switch color schemes a few years at a time. I also consider fashion a special interest. I’m also about to study Accounting and Psychology in college, and I feel like careers in both fields will require professionalism and class. I like fun and youth, but I also feel like I come across as childish, and that people won’t take me seriously if I look the way I do.

411;zk80an;Would you find it weird if a good friend never checked out content you’ve created?;I write poems and I have an Instagram page for them. <newline>  <newline> This is mainly a hypothetical situation, really. But I’ve had similar situations in the past. If I had someone who I considered to be a fairly good friend (as in, we regularly talked and met up) and I told them about the page and invited them to like/follow it and they didn’t, and I know they’re active on social media (if they’re inactive or never use it, fair enough) or they say they’ll check the page out and they never do, I’d find it weird.

414;zbakkk;Next step after exchanging instas;Hello! I’m 21F and a senior in college. I am trying to make new friends as I’m pretty socially isolated on campus. I saw someone in a to-go place in town that was wearing merch of our school and we complimented each other’s styles as they are both very nontraditional. We made good small talk and she left after receiving her order. She initiated swapping instas and we did but I use mine very rarely as I fail to see the appeal of it (I did not express this). Was she initiating future connection or politely trying to end the interaction? What is the next step after exchanging instas? If I’m trying to have a larger social circle, would it help to use Instagram more? I’m really good at initiatial positive interactions but don’t understand the process of following up to establish a friendship.

415;z8zylh;Altered or loss of smell after covid-19 and what it's been like for sensory processing for you? Tips dealing with difficulties with food and appetite?;Does anybody else have altered or loss of smell after having covid-19? I was curious what your experiences with this may be? Do any of you have advice to dealing with ARFID and difficulties with eating and food?   <newline>  <newline> I've had altered smell for over 1 year now and it's been a blessing and a curse. I can't smell farts, perfume, skunk, cigarettes, it burning... but onions, body odor, rotting, and onions all smell identical to me and the intensity doesn't match how intense it should actually smell. I was highly sensitive to smells (my face and nose would burn if anybody near me wore perfume or cologne, I thought I was allergic but now that I can't smell it I don't get the sensation either which makes me think this was a sensory sensitivity). The downside is that I can't smell my own body odor or decipher what I'm smelling. I also have struggled a great deal with eating, since I can't smell rotting and many foods don't taste how I remember them to it makes eating anxiety inducing and unpredictable and less enjoyable. I LOVED to eat before...  <newline>  <newline> The whole parosmia experience has also just been extremely interesting for me. I joined a parosmia support group in Facebook and my case is substantially more mild than most who post on there, but their altered smells are so similar to mine but some are not at all what I experience.;Whitty2697;False;5;1.0;2022-11-30 19:03:34;/r/aspergirls/comments/z8zylh/altered_or_loss_of_smell_after_covid19_and_what/;aspergirls
416;z7wc32;Thoughts on body language and the double empathy problem;I’m sure some of us are better or worse at picking up on body language. I think I have a good grasp on it. I tend to overanalyze interactions looking for signs of possible discomfort. However, that doesn’t come easy for many people on spectrum, if at all.  <newline>  <newline> The other day a user posted a tiktok account of an allistic woman explaining the purpose behind neurotypical small talk and it suddenly clicked for me. A few of the things to take away from it:  <newline>  <newline> - Alllistic people can be terrified of ‘not being nice enough.’ This is, of course, in a different way autistic people might be terrified of not being nice.  <newline>  <newline> - Small talk is a way of acknowledging another person’s presence and making them feel comfortable and possibly bonding with them. It’s also their way of testing the waters to gauge someone else’s mood.  <newline>  <newline> Now let’s move on to another tiktok that goes something like this: “When you’re overstimulated and someone starts to tell you their whole life story. 🙄”  <newline>  <newline> A lot of the people in the comments were making the typical remarks: “they are NPCs, they have no instincts, etc” ln the context of being unable to ‘read the room’ or pick up on social cues. they do not want to be bothered even if they are half-smiling and nodding politely to the person telling the story. It should be implied by the tone in which they say “right, right… 🙃.” <newline>  <newline> Reminder of allistic social norms and the dread of coming across as rude. <newline>  <newline> My first reaction is frustration. Why is it so hard for them to verbalize “Sorry, I’m not in a good headspace right now. Can we continue this later?” <newline>  <newline> It’s frustrating that our honesty is pathologized as social blindness, when the world could be so much better if communication weren’t so complicated. Right?  <newline>  <newline> But then it occurred to me, to them it’s never that simple. Why? Because their system of communication relies on assumptions and extrapolations for the most part.  <newline>  <newline> Let’s say that they were to stop someone mid sentence: “Sorry, I have so much going on right now. Let’s talk later.”  <newline>  <newline> If the other person is also allistic, they could interpret that in so many negative ways.  <newline>  <newline> “Take a hint, I don’t wanna be friends with you.”  <newline>  <newline> or  <newline>  <newline> “Take a hint, you’re annoying.”  <newline>  <newline> To them, it’s never as simple as being straightforward. It’s neurotic and unproductive but it’s just how they’re wired.

418;z3adt1;Job nightmare, and HR is actively making it worse;"The abuse at work has reached fever pitch. Sorry for the text wall, but I really need sanity and support.  <newline>  <newline> Got my PhD, applied to undergrad alumni because they had an opening. They called me next day all excited. I disclosed ASD, during interview. They claimed they understood and agreed to accomodations.  <newline>  <newline> As soon as I was officially hired they turned. I have a history of being pathetically submissive, formal, etc that has been established with psych. Supervisors have said so. My teaching reviews are always positive with the occasional ""too nice"" point dock (it makes me laugh, honestly). Never once had issues like this at any university, including another one I'm working at right now, or with any person in my life.  <newline>  <newline> I've been called innapropriate, rude, demanding, etc for asking for basic materials. I deliberately take steps in all I write to be polite and non intrusive, so I was beyond shocked. I followed my supervisors instructions, but even when she told me on record in email, she denies it. When I asked why/what I said was a problem because I didn't want to cause problems, I was ignored. I was condescended to blatantly by others when I explained I could not do what was asked without being given certain materials. When I showed distress with time for the semester running out,  they admitted to gossiping about how awful I was and told me my communications with every single person at the school was innapropriate. Every single person. Obviously this is agonizingly triggering. <newline>  <newline> I contacted HR to officially to establish disability status formally, giving them NO specifics and not calling a single person out. I said I just wanted to be in the system. They quickly responded sarcastically to me saying I did ""not feel safe"" and suggested ""if I ACTUALLY believe I qualify as disabled, we can proceed."" I am waiting on the form from my doc after having to assure her that I qualify. In the meantime, HR has been nothing but rude to the point of blatant abuse.  <newline>  <newline> There was an issue because I was backing up emails by forwarding, which IT informed her. HR told me I was violating university business and trying to ""bring university business outside the university"". I said I was only backing up, I had no idea it wasn't allowed, but I'll turn it off immediately (10x sorry). I get a long email about how I am caustic, questioning the university, and threatened with being forced out. All this because I mentioned ""I didn't have this policy before, so I didnt realize"". Apparently to her, that meant I was arguing, and nothing I could say would change that. I call her to try and iron this out. She shouts that I am caustic, interrupts me, tells me I'm worse than a freshman, entitled, rude. I'm crying at this point and begging them to let me explain, ""I am not trying to disparage your university, ma'am. I immediately listened. I turned forwarding off immediately. I was explaining I didn't mean to harm the university and didn't realize...!"".  She tells me I'm unacceptable, tells me to pull myself together.  <newline>  <newline> Don't worry, I am still screenshotting their messages.... <newline>  <newline> She tells me everyone has a problem with me. That they have all talked and agreed. That I should ""think about what I say so I don't have to say sorry"". I tell her I am trying, and I apologize to get out ahead of what seems like negative assumptions. I read my emails literally dozens of times, ask neurotypicals to review them. No problems detected. But these people always find a reason to distort what I say to an EXTREME negative. They think it's justified because they are a bully group, but it's obvious it's a small college clic thing. They don't even feel shame admitting they are coordinating with each other to maintain this abuse, even HR!! I SEE what's going on, but internalizing it and not believing them is SO hard.  <newline>  <newline> I look her up on linkedin and this HR person has a ton of hateful content about welfare and the disabled. I couldn't believe it. Racist, anti-gay, transphobic, anti-poor, ""it's your fault if you aren't successful"", pro Jan 6th. This is on a public, professional profile! It's beyond belief. This can't be happening. <newline>  <newline> I also found out that all this time asking them if there was a place I could find these rules so I stop breaking them... They never gave me the legally required handbook. Never mentioned it. Didn't know it existed.  <newline>  <newline> I feel utterly broken. I just wanted to work. I just wanted to contribute. It may sound cliche, but I genuinely do not want to make any waves or disrupt anything. I am scared to death right now of every single world I say, loop reading and changing every word to be inoffensive when it wasn't even bad to start with. Anything that might be taken in the worst way is eliminated, but they find a reason to attack me no matter what. I'm sick constantly, having physical symptoms, suicidal thoughts (under control and doctor handled, but still).  <newline>  <newline> This place was safe for me when I was an undergrad, and now it is like some bizarre mirror world. No matter how hard I try to be submissive, apologetic, follow the rules, etc, they find a way to twist it like an abusive relationship. It feels like gaslighting, and there's 3 or 4 women participating and OPENLY admitting to colluding, yet they think that proves their legitimacy in numbers. <newline>  <newline>  I never thought it could be this bad. I got a PhD and get treated like a child and a monster for trying to do my job. I always aim to be kind. I always aim to make life easier for others. I know I am not what they say.

I'm the kind of person who can be a bit overwhelming in the wrong context, so I really rely on being clearly told what is and isn't okay, or being told to stop if I go too far, but it's really difficult for me to do this when I'm actually being told the *opposite* of what someone wants. <newline>  <newline> So I'm part of a small discord group of about 6 active users in which we have regular calls to chat or play games with each other. I chat with a few of the members outside of the server about various things, but there's one girl with whom I tended to approach for advise or emotional support. For a long time, there didn't seem to be an issue, but as I started to have more issues lately, it had a knock-on effect where I'd end up confiding in her more than I probably should have. I did have a feeling that maybe I'd been troubling her too much, and I would frequently ask if she was still okay with me doing this to which she'd often respond, ""you're fine, talk to me if you need to!"" or even going as far as saying ""I'm happy that you'd come to me for this"" (note: not direct quotes due to the conversations not being in English). I still had a suspicion that things weren't quite so okay, because there were times that she kinda didn't say much, or didn't respond to me at all, but when I asked about that she'd just say that she was busy, and that it's nothing to worry about. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, this week, I had a particularly bad mental breakdown, and my emotional instability kinda rippled into my friend group causing tensions. After I'd seemingly pissed everyone off, they all started to message me yelling about how much I was hurting that one friend that I'd confided in over all this time, and that nowadays she was losing sleep talking to me, or getting stressed out, ect. I said that I wasn't aware of any of this, so when I approached her to apologize because I'd heard that I'd hurt her, she kinda blew up in anger in  way I'd never seen from her before, saying things like: ""I know that there's a timezone difference, but didn't you think that maybe I'd want to go to sleep late in the evening?"" and ""well maybe if you felt like I wasn't in the mood to talk you should have taken the hint"" <newline>  <newline> I tried to point out that I really can't read stuff like this, and need to be told directly to stop or I won't realize. Whenever we talked, I repeatedly tried to check in if she was okay, and she kept telling me it was fine, so I genuinely had no way of knowing that I'd crossed a line. She seems to expect that I should just know that she couldn't take it anymore, even saying: ""just because I say it's okay you don't think that there's a problem?"" to which I can only say: ***yes***. How am I supposed to interpret that any differently??? I even told her that it's a difficulty I have due to my autism and she blew it off like a cheap excuse and said I was just being selfish. <newline>  <newline> I feel really hurt by all this. She was someone I considered a really good friend, and this fallout seems to have rippled into the entire community getting angry at me, so I feel like I've lost an entire friend group over a misunderstanding that I couldn't possibly have interpreted the way I was expected to.";Rinabow;False;13;0.93;2022-11-16 05:35:34;/r/aspergirls/comments/ywl0sp/i_dont_understand_why_nts_will_tell_me_one_thing/;aspergirls

It has since died down to a regular interest but I still know all the personal finance stuff and am subscribe to a personal finance YouTube channel or two. So, when my family wants help with personal finance topics I tend to be the one they call, and I am always trilled for the chance to give advice. <newline>  <newline> My grandma called me this morning and apparently I literally everyone in my family had mentioned how it helped them with their personal finances, repeatedly. And how when she talked to them about budgeting, and insurance, and home buying, they kept mentioning that when they did the personal finance thing, it was based on knowledge I gave them. They kept mentioning me as how they learned they could do the thing.  <newline>  <newline> It's just really nice to be appreciated.;tinyevilsponges;False;4;0.92;2022-11-12 16:03:57;/r/aspergirls/comments/ytb0r9/my_special_interest_has_been_helpful_to_people/;aspergirls
426;yn8ctm;Being overly reliant on passive input (ie watching/listening to youtube too much, multitasking on Pinterest, but averse to reading or crafts);"I don't know how to summarise this. A lot of the time I feel a strong urge to have youtube on in the background when I'm alone, and spend way too much time on my computer, forgetting about all the other things I could be doing if I weren't online. I have a few types of content that I like to watch, and will open up Pinterest alongside or google stuff because youtube alone isn't engaging enough and I get so bored and frustrated but I can't make myself do anything else. Often I do this to procrastinate on other things I feel I should be doing. Other times I might feel like there are things I need to do but there actually aren't, but I can't let myself sit in quiet for long enough to take stock and make a plan for what I do want to do with my time. It's also important to me that it's stuff I can passively take in - so watching or listening to something, instead of reading (which I do enjoy, but often don't feel I have the energy for, or it's hard to get into a book, and I often lost momentum partway through and then can't make myself restart from where I left off). <newline>  <newline> I do this a lot when tired and kind of think of it as my ""recharging"" activity, but in reality I don't think it helps me recharge, at best it helps me decompress a bit. I don't think I have an internet addiction or something because I can be totally happy doing my own thing when I'm out and about or at work or going for a walk... I easily forget about the stuff I watch and don't feel a pull to get to a computer or anything. But when I'm alone at home I just cannot bear not having a lot going on around me.  <newline>  <newline> I can't tell if it's needing a break from overstimulation or social overwhelm, if I'm understimulated, if I'm just distracting myself and can't tolerate my feelings when I'm not distracted, if it's just executive dysfunction... I suspect I may have ADHD as well as being autistic but haven't been able to get myself to fill in the forms for the ADHD assessment. <newline>  <newline> I feel kind of broken or like there's something wrong with me, I feel like other people do so much with their free time and have lots of hobbies they're passionate about. I have things I like to do but I only do them when they're part of my routine and I've planned them into my day/week already, I'm not good at doing things spontaneously or just ""doing whatever I feel like"". So I just sit around like a potato all day.

427;yl4u5b;does anyone else really struggle with hair, makeup, skincare, etc?;i hate how i am pressured to do these things, like almost all women do their skincare, style their hair and wear makeup every day and it's what i've always been told i should do. it's either i force myself to do it or i am the odd one out and it's hard enough being autistic and acting differently to other women  without the added pressure of having to force myself to do these things when i really don't want to. i feel like everyone i know naturally took an interest in makeup when they were young and they all enjoy the super in-depth routine of applying it every day. it also doesn't help that i'm a perfectionist and i find it unbearable to do things that i'm not interested in so i just feeling like going to bed whenever i even try to do anything related to this lol <newline>  <newline> i just can't cope with how there are so many obstacles and so many different ways of doing things. it's like: i buy foundation. it shows all of the textures on my skin and my smile lines look even worse than without it, so i watch a youtube video on how to stop creasing and textures. i follow the tutorial perfectly and buy all of the right products and it still doesn't work. i can't stand how there's a problem that i can't fix, i find a solution, but the solution doesn't work. i end up crying in front of the mirror every time i try because it's so stressful to me. i bought moisturizer for sensitive skin. it ended up giving me milia so now i know that i have milia prone sensitive skin but how am i supposed to know what products to use?? it's all just so stressful for me :(;stupid_rice;False;35;0.97;2022-11-03 14:51:25;/r/aspergirls/comments/yl4u5b/does_anyone_else_really_struggle_with_hair_makeup/;aspergirls

429;yjarft;I just don’t want to work anymore;I’m having a really REALLY hard time.  <newline> This is going to be long because I’m trying to get all my feeling out and trying to give relevant details to try to help you understand what’s in my head. I apologize and appreciate you if you read this.  <newline>  <newline> Background:  <newline> I’ve been in childcare for 10 years now. I’ve seen all kinds of parents. The good and bad and in between and how that effects their kids. I mentally have been gathering notes on what *I* wanted to do as a mom. From the families I worked for and from my own upbringing. You know how our minds are, always analyzing. Never off.  <newline>  <newline> I got diagnosed late after becoming a mom myself. Child development is a special interest of mine. I’m very “youthful” in the things that bring me  extreme joy. (Drawing, animated movies, watching my skirt swing when I sway, the simple things in life like a beautiful cloud or details of a flower, etc etc.) I was self conscious about it before my diagnosis. Now I’m just like, “ahhh, that makes sense.” It makes me good with kids. Like, super good. I don’t want to sound arrogant, but I’m actually really good at being a mom. I feel like I’m better at it than a lot of people I’ve worked for. I know that sounds so bad. I know there are good parents out there, but I haven’t been around many lately.  <newline>  <newline> The current family I work for is rough. Like, I’ve seen a total breakdown of a family in the last couple of years with them. I started out doing what I always did, putting everything out there to help. I read parenting books, listened to YouTube and podcasts for advice from professionals in their field, bent over backwards to make their lives easier. You name it, I did it. After a while it was clear the parents didn’t want to change. They wanted their kids to change their behavior without sticking to anything themselves. It sucks. It sucks for the kids who’s lives will be effected forever. My heart hurts.  <newline>  <newline> And now I have my own child. One who I love more than anything. She is joy personified. So so smart. These early years are so important and it pains me to miss any time with her with this family.  <newline>  <newline> My husband started a new job. We are so so lucky that his salary alone could support us. We agreed that I would only keep working until we have our second child. Then I can stay home until both kids are in kindergarten. I was close to that dream, but I miscarried. Now we need to start all over and I’m stuck working even longer.  <newline>  <newline> I don’t want to work anymore. I want to ask him if I can just stop. But I feel selfish. I feel lazy. Can’t I just suck it up for at minimum 9 more months? <newline> These are all thoughts in my head, by the way. My husband has never said anything bad about me.  <newline>  <newline> Idk. Idk what to do. I hate complaining about the same thing over and over when someone asks how things are.

431;yhxqzc;I feel like I am babysitting my autistic friend and I feel like a hypocrite for thinking so;I am borderline on the spectrum. I have severe ADHD, anxiety, and depression among other learning disabilities and feel like I have no room to judge but my autistic friend M is driving me crazy.  <newline>  <newline> M is 32F. I am 29F. M wants to hang out a lot. Like every weekend for this past month. I have a fiancé who I spend time with (we don’t live together) and/or I’m busy working most of the time. Up until over a week ago, I had a job that kept me super busy, but since I lost that job, M wants my time again.  <newline>  <newline> I have spent time with M and I have enjoyed it, but there are things she does that makes me not look forward to it. <newline>  <newline> First, I feel like I have to do everything for her. M has so little confidence that she’ll stand there and wait for me to do things for her unless I tell her to do things. For instance, I had to tell M to shut the door going into the garage after we came inside because she wouldn’t do it on her own and almost let our dogs escape. Another time, I will have to tell her to take her plate to the sink after dinner as if she hadn’t been hanging out at my house for about a decade. Tonight, I had to tell M to make her own plate when my Mom called us down to dinner because she was just standing there acting like she was clueless to know what to do. <newline>  <newline> I feel like saying this makes me sound so ableist, but I’m tired of having to take the lead in every situation because M freezes and needs someone to tell her what to do. Sometimes, even when I do tell her, M panics and messes up. Like one time, I told her to move my chair back to where she moved it from while we were getting ready to go and her performance anxiety was so bad that she accidentally knocked over my Nintendo Switch and broke one of the controllers. <newline>  <newline> M can also be exhausting because of her excessive need to eat and talk. <newline>  <newline> M cannot wait for a meal. She will scour the fridge or cabinet to make herself something to eat or drink. We will feed M dinner but then she wants me to drive her to McDonald’s to buy her another dinner or she will make multiple sandwiches and meals in between normal meal times. <newline>  <newline> M will stop whatever we’re doing to ask random questions or make random statements. Tonight, she wasn’t as bad, but several weeks ago, I had to keep pausing a YouTube video I wanted to get through so she could finish expressing all her thoughts or ask questions she had. I finally had to tell her to can it until the video was done.  <newline>  <newline> Again, I am not a normal person either. I know what it’s like to be different. That’s why I feel like such a jerk for getting this annoyed. I just get tired of feeling like I am babysitting instead of hanging out. This friend is loyal, supportive, and willing to go on adventures with me. She has issues, but she isn’t a terrible friend.

433;yf0yq7;Some (online) social success!;Just wanted to share some success I’ve had interacting with strangers in communities online (obviously being safe) in case you are feeling isolated or in case it gives you ideas.  <newline>  <newline> I struggle to fit into groups because masking takes so much focus 😅 so I’ve been trying to spend more time alone doing things I enjoy. As I’ve done this, I actually found two easy ways to socialize. <newline>  <newline> One is Coursera. I started taking Michigan State’s novel writing course (totally free) on Coursera, and the class forces you to post your writing and give and receive feedback on writing from other students - without having to try to join a group or figure out the social vibe! I feel connected to other people via one of my hobbies/special interests, without having to worry about awkwarding people out or being left out! Yay!  <newline>  <newline> The second one is this app called 365 gratitude. The app gives you daily gratitude prompts. It also provides this Facebook-like forum where you can post, like, and share gratitude moments. I’ve avoided the social part of the app for a whole year because I always feel I offend someone on social media and I hate coming off as insensitive, but recently I gave the social side of this app a chance and I really liked it. This app (and prob others like it) is great because people are JUST posting about gratitude. Having a topic makes me feel like I have something to add to the conversation that I know people will be interested in. And everyone is so positive (since it’s a positivity app haha), I don’t worry about people being mean.  <newline>  <newline> Anyways hope this helps you look for your own ways of socializing if you are struggling.

434;ybsapb;Did anybody else have intense compulsions to touch things/do repetitive things as a kid?;Disclaimer: I’m not diagnosed, but I have 2 immediate family members on the spectrum, and am almost positive I am as well.  Im seeking testing but as you all know, lengthy and expensive process. <newline>  <newline> So, I know this sounds kind of like a hallmark, but hear me out.  When I was a kid, I remember these intense urges to do the most random repetitive things.  They were never backed by an irrational threat like I’ve heard of in OCD, but I couldn’t NOT do these things.  Ie: I had to get up repeatedly from the couch and touch the corner of the TV, or I had to touch a button on a computer repetitively, or I had to chew on equal sides of my mouth when I ate.  The need to do these things was constant, and not doing them was mentally excruciating.   <newline>  <newline> I still have issues like this when I think about an action too long—I used to have to wiggle my ears over and over until I was distracted from it.  It is really difficult to describe, but I remember as a kid forcing myself to stop doing these things because they negatively impacted my life/felt “weird” or “wrong.”  There were points where I had these compulsions to tense my neck or shoulders, to the point that I was constantly sore from it.   <newline>  <newline> Today, I have my routines and rituals, and I don’t do them because I’m scared of an irrational problem occurring if I don’t follow through with my routines.  I do them because they bring me comfort, and I just like them.  IE: have been making and eating the exact same lunch nearly every day for months now, need to do things in order for maximum perceived outcome.  (When I eat dinner, I prefer to shower beforehand, be comfortable, have a clean space and a favorite YouTuber set up on my laptop, and a full cup of ice water.  Otherwise, I don’t enjoy my meal as much.  I can deviate, but I prefer not to.) <newline>  <newline> Anyway, does anybody else have a similar story?  I’ve always wondered about this, and last night it occurred to me that it could be neurodivergency instead of just another weird kid thing.;2_222_2;False;2;0.84;2022-10-23 20:37:54;/r/aspergirls/comments/ybsapb/did_anybody_else_have_intense_compulsions_to/;aspergirls

I just wish I could have spent more time with it as I would have liked to work more on one or two areas.  <newline>  <newline> We followed “DBT skills revision” by Marsha Linehan and it covered four areas: **Mindfulness** (I discovered mindful movement was more my thing than meditation), **Distress Tolerance** (some useful tools to try to use when you’re overwhelmed, definitely easier said than done 😅), **Interpersonal Effectiveness** (what you should expect from a relationship (healthy boundaries) and what should be expected from you, and **Emotional Regulation** (teaches you how to identify (through bodily sensations) and label different emotions like in photos 7 to 16 in the album. Gives you tools in how to deal with them through identifying if it’s an appropriate response and how to handle them if it might not be). <newline>  <newline> I uploaded most of the worksheets I got for the emotional regulation section included my horribly hand written notes for a comment on another post here and said I may as well share them in a post since it was work getting imgur to cooperate on my phone 😂  I’m not sure where my other worksheets are at the moment but I’m sure you could find a pdf of the same or a related workbook.

439;y8drxh;autism and social media addiction?;"i've had a lot of difficulty weaning myself off from social media. i've been on various platforms since i was around 12, mainly twitter and tumblr. i realize how harmful these platforms these are to my own mental health, but the difficulty is that i have trouble replacing the large amount of time i spend on these sites with anything meaningful. <newline>  <newline> i thought that perhaps this was an issue primarily regarding executive function and adhd, but getting properly medicated has not done as much as i'd like to in redirecting myself away from these habits. in thinking about this, i wonder if it's perhaps to related to some aspect of autism, and the processing of emotions. one hypothesis maybe, but the way in which i interact with social media relates a lot to validation of my own self, and seeing myself through the lenses of other people. i suspect that a lot of difficulties i have with seeking validation irl and social interaction make me fall back on social media where the ""rules"" for engagement are more clear. i also have this feeling of anxiety when i'm not ""plugged in"" that i might be missing important information. <newline>  <newline> now i have a lot of different hobbies that i engage in, and ideally i'd want to just be able to use my time to focus primarily on these (cooking, reading, making music, DJ'ing, drawing, etc.). but it seems like i get frustrated so easily during creative ventures (i'm unfortunately a perfectionist though i'm trying to unlearn that), and even with video games i have difficulty with getting fully immersed. which of course makes me feel insecure because of the amount of content i see on social media about how these platforms eradicate your attention span. <newline>  <newline> tl:dr is there a connection between the ways emotions and communications work for those under the autistic spectrum and the dopamine rush of social media? <newline>  <newline> i guess what i want to ask is: have any of you had this issue before, or maybe some tips as to how to redirect myself away from spending most of my day online (i've tried a lot of things to no effect unfortunately)? or is it just a lost cause in this ever-online world?";throwaway-jhh;False;3;0.86;2022-10-19 20:43:07;/r/aspergirls/comments/y8drxh/autism_and_social_media_addiction/;aspergirls
440;y7qhne;The recent posts about Demand Avoidance may finally give context to so many of my 'quirks' that I kept to myself;"Someone here had shared information about demand avoidance, a neurodivergent trait or profile that entails a chronic avoidance of demands, expectations, and other tasks - even ones that may be enjoyable - and it's opened up a huge can of worms for me.

When I can build a list this big just from the top of my head in a single sitting, you can definitely imagine how it adds up to have a tangible impact on my daily life. <newline>  <newline> \- I avoid responding to texts and other message notifications no matter how much I want to talk to the person who sent them <newline>  <newline> \- Hobby projects take forever to complete because each task feels like a chore, even though it's a hobby I enjoy <newline>  <newline> \- I go for fun hikes and bike rides less often than I want because I feel personally obligated to spend at least an hour on each trip and that makes me not want to do it at all <newline>  <newline> \- Tasks that take mere seconds or less than 5 minutes to complete get totally forgotten about because my brain thinks ""doesn't take long to do"" = ""it must be inconsequential and so it's ok if I don't do it now even though it'd only take a moment"" <newline>  <newline> \- I eat certain foods I enjoy less often than I want, like fresh fruit, because they're hidden in the fridge and I need to wash or cut them first, and consequently eat more unhealthy food because it's convenient.. except I still choose bananas, because they make no demands of me! I just have to peel them and go! <newline>  <newline> \- I delay using the restroom even when there's nothing else keeping my attention and even when it gets to be really uncomfortable <newline>  <newline> \- I open lots of internet tabs or add youtube videos to a Watch Later playlist, only to never view them <newline>  <newline> \- I almost never try playing new video games, even if they're free and no matter how much a friend wants me to try them <newline>  <newline> \- When I knew I was in the wrong, I would only apologize if no one had yet demanded I do so (thankfully I grew out of this one lol but it was a thing when I was little) <newline>  <newline> \- I try to find loopholes or shortcuts to avoid tasks, ultimately spending more mental and physical energy than the original task would have required <newline>  <newline> \- I lean on excuses and procrastinate until it's decided I don't have to complete an expected task anymore <newline>  <newline> \- I look to people I trust, such as my mom, to get me out of obligations I can't mentally handle <newline>  <newline> \- I sometimes get uncomfortable if someone asks me to make a decision when I didn't think I needed to have made a decision yet or at all *(example from a few minutes ago: my mom bought carrot cake and asked me if I'd want any tomorrow, and I struggled to answer because even though I didn't want any tonight, I couldn't fathom why I had to decide if I wouldn't want any tomorrow, either, because I would've either decided I wanted some in the moment or just never had any. And so it became a whole back-and-forth because my mom wanted to know but I really didn't want to spend any more mental energy on something that seemed so inconsequential)* <newline>  <newline> \- I have extreme trouble getting myself to perform tasks that I don't see the purpose of or that I perceive as a waste of time, like mowing the lawn (and then waste more time and cause grief trying to get out of it) <newline>  <newline> \- I often stand idly staring off into space during my nightly getting-ready-for-bed routine instead of just hurrying up and getting it done so I can stare off into space in my cozy bed instead <newline>  <newline> \- I get an unshakeable sense of unease when I have upcoming obligations or tasks later in the day, even if I know they'll be fun, and especially if I don't know when those obligations will be or if they're tasks I can't start until later";WHATSTHEYAAAMS;False;39;0.99;2022-10-19 02:36:38;/r/aspergirls/comments/y7qhne/the_recent_posts_about_demand_avoidance_may/;aspergirls

442;y7gqe1;DAE experience being socially ganged up on/ permanently viewed as knowing less than?;"I feel I can never have enough evidence and I feel  <newline> I will always be written off as knowing nothing or not enough to have a valid opinion or express a valid statement /sentiment. <newline>  <newline> Like I know me, I don't need a degree for that <newline> But since every adult views a degree as the voice of all knowing objectivity. My experiences are always up for debate. Like if I say I behave this way because this or this feels like, or I observed this and came to realising this, or I engage in these habits because of these disturbances, it's always no you do this because of this or you feel this way because of this or you behave this way because you are this way, or the old and gold it's because you smoke. if I say medical professionals have biases  influenced by culture, age, sex etc. it's always they have the degree they know better than you. <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  They know human behaviour as a general, not as individuals. I feel like I'm constantly having to fight off people perceiving me as  low intellectual ability to comprehend/understand BASIC SHIT and I feel it's because they have an idealised version of how I would or should present/behave so they're Like no no no YOU don't understand YOU. <newline>  Like no, I understand me I even try and teach people about me but it's like they reject the information, the can't emphasize with the unique perspective/experience they can't ACCEPT.  It very very often feels like if the information is coming from me it's not valid, people even challenge me on information ABOUT ME.  <newline>  <newline>  I know this can't be normal, it's especially confusing with how often people accuse me of being arrogant or having some sort of intellectual superiority complex yet at the same time I'm treated like I know nothing, doesn't matter how much time I spend researching, how many citations, it almost feels like they don't even believe any resources doesn't matter if it was academic literature or fieldwork or experience, nothing is treated as credible. Yet at the same time they are so comfortable citing a Facebook post as valid accurate and credible information or their fuckin buddy. <newline>  <newline>  I feel special in the way that it doesn't matter which social sphere I enter no matter the hierarchy or where I lie , I will always be invalid and treated with condescension and in a patronising manner. Also, others are allowed to back track and be hypocritical but everyone can always find unity to seek to discredit, invalidate or dismiss any information I give or my experiences. That's what I mean when I say I can always be sniffed out it's such a unique experience as an autistic woman the way that you are subtly held to different standards of morality, validity, credibility, accuracy etc. And people never believe me when I say it because it's so innocuous so subtle, and it's majority Vs minority dynamic: NTs lack that perspective as they have not had the contrasting unique social position to experience this common phenomena of essentially being socially ""ganged"" up on.

444;y6m2tj;Fear of new forms of social media?;it’s been a recurring weird quirk of mine that I feel like connects to my autism/ADHD/social anxiety that I have a really hard time adjusting to new forms of social media. Here’s my irrational hang ups for things that I want to use more but don’t check much:  <newline>  <newline> Snapchat: did something really embarrassing in 2014 when I first started using it (accidentally posted a photo publicly that should have been private) and ever since I’ve had an account, that I rarely check and have been hesitant to get into it  <newline>  <newline> Twitter: I can’t contain my random weird thoughts to 160 characters??  <newline>  <newline> TikTok or YouTube: I just … don’t really like watching videos all that often. I don’t usually have the ability to watch something that plays out loud without other people hearing. I don’t want to annoyingly be playing videos out loud on my phone: it’s a sensory trigger for me when other people do, or ask me to watch a bunch of videos for random things in a row. I don’t have good headphones right now. <newline>  <newline> Twitch: is going to give me FOMO too much until I get my streaming stuff all ready to go - I used to DJ online and want to DJ and stream games online soon. I’ve made some progress but still have work to do.  <newline>  <newline> Discord: I felt like I said something awkward maybe once or twice and now I’m nervous to try again. I also don’t have a lot of servers that I’d be interested in enough to check all the time and feel weird jumping into communities that already exist .. like how would I know if I wasn’t welcome there or being annoying unless I said something stupid enough to get banned or restricted  <newline>  <newline> Basically all I use frequently is Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit? And I meet people from time to time who don’t really use FB or Instagram much but use other things and then I’m not able to stay in touch with them.

447;y52h2m;Brain autofilling information?;So this is something that I’ve somewhat been aware of all my life but ever since my mom told me she suspected that I might be autistic for years (I’m 33 now) it’s starting to bother me more now. I’ll read a sentence or two and my brain will autofill information that isn’t in the sentence and I end up misinterpreting the sentence to the point of embarrassing myself. I’ll give some examples -Today I found out that the planned meet-up place with friends tomorrow was a completely different location than I thought it was a few days ago when I was invited to said meet-up. I saw one specific word and thought that we were meeting at a place in my hometown. Luckily the guy who made the plans gave us the address and it’s a completely different venue in the next city over. Another recent example is when I had to set up a security question for a website that said “what was your first computer game” and my brain processed it as “what was your first video game” so now my answer to this question is technically wrong and I have to keep a note of this for myself.  <newline>  <newline> Is this an autism thing? Is my brain this impatient to process info at a faster speed than I am physically capable of reading that it gets ahead of itself and jumps to wrong conclusions? This is rather frustrating especially on Discord when I feel that speed is most important in a fast-pace online space. I’ll speed read people’s comment and accidentally repeat something they said just a minute ago because I somehow missed seeing those details because my brain info dumps on itself upon seeing a few words about the topic at the beginning.;yamirenamon;False;4;0.9;2022-10-16 00:02:05;/r/aspergirls/comments/y52h2m/brain_autofilling_information/;aspergirls

Because I wasn't emotional or girly enough. But in retrospect it probably had more to do with the fact that I was missing social nuance and based my masking techniques on characters in YA novels and movies.  <newline>  <newline> I honestly just wish I could have realized that I was different, instead of thinking that girls were just inherently mean or cliquey.

449;xzj429;How to determine if someone would be a good friend?;TW: mention of suicidal thoughts <newline>  <newline> Sometimes I struggle figuring out whether to become friends with someone, because I can be too harsh sometimes and cut people out over small things.  <newline>  <newline> In the last couple of years I’ve been making the effort to make new friends, we meet via Facebook groups, chat and then meet up in person and that’s worked out really well for me! However, there’s one person I’ve spoken to for a while and we’ve just not had a chance to meet yet (she also has autism and ADHD btw), we do get on generally but there’s been a few things that have now made me hesitant to meet her.  <newline>  <newline> There have been quite a few instances where she has substantially overshared about her mental health (including feeling suicidal) when I’ve literally told her I’m struggling myself. Especially with new friends or people I’ve not met, I am honest but very vague and will say things like I’m really stressed and struggling a bit etc, I never give more detail because I’m very aware that this stuff is heavy for people. This is really triggering for me because a long time ago I experienced very dark and suicidal thoughts and it’s just not something I want hear about from someone I don’t know that well. I have to provide emotional support to family members who have mental health issues and I don’t have the capacity to be someone else’s therapist. It is a bit of a red flag to me that this person keeps sharing things like this with me. I feel bad that I shut down as soon as someone starts telling me about severe mental health issues and expecting me to provide support, but I just can’t cope with it. <newline>  <newline> Am I being too harsh/quick to judge if I decide not to go ahead and meet this person? I’m worried if I meet her it will then be even harder to end the friendship. Or should I give her a chance and see how it goes in person? <newline>  <newline> TLDR: unsure whether to meet a newish friend (we met online) in person because she often overshares her quite severe mental health struggles, expecting me to provide emotional support, which I can’t cope with.;Sunflowers_0419;False;5;1.0;2022-10-09 11:14:43;/r/aspergirls/comments/xzj429/how_to_determine_if_someone_would_be_a_good_friend/;aspergirls

451;xvq665;Seeking other people with long covid because I feel so alone right now;I developed long covid after getting sick in early July this year.  My symptoms have been brain fog and fatigue.  The brain fog has mainly just exacerbated some of the issues I already faced because of my Autism, ADHD, and Anxiety.  As a few examples: my executive functioning in many areas has gone from somewhat impaired to basically non-functional, my sensory processing issues are more sensitive, and my anxiety response gets triggered more easily.  I've been working with my therapist and my husband has been really supportive and understanding, plus I have a very close friend with numerous ongoing health issues who understands the emotions that I'm dealing with, but I don't actually know anyone else who is struggling in the same way I am and I have been feeling so alone in this.   <newline>  <newline> When I try to look up things about long covid, I find articles that talk about the experience for neurotypical people, which just isn't the same as the experience I'm having, where covid basically made my disorders worse.  <newline>  <newline> I'm just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat I am.

458;xnsq66;The Unthinkable of Autistic Mind, 8 Autistic Strengths in Cognitive Abilities (Part 2);Part 1 of this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/xi7243/why\_many\_inventors\_discoverers\_are\_autistic\_8/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/xi7243/why_many_inventors_discoverers_are_autistic_8/) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> https://preview.redd.it/lwa3503eb1q91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d291552db1d73b363366554539bddee9ac39c2ee <newline>  <newline> **5. Superior problem-solving** <newline>  <newline> According to a new study from Université de Montréal and Harvard University, in the journal Human Brain Mapping, Autistic people are up to 40% faster at problem-solving. Autistic people also appear to accelerate their problem-solving skills by using their perceptual regions of the brain. In this study, participants completed Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test. This test measures hypothesis-testing, problem-solving, and learning skills. Some critics argued that autistics might be unable to complete the RSPM because of its complexity. Nevertheless, this study proves otherwise. It shows autistics complete the test as efficiently and even have more highly developed perceptions than non-autistics. <newline>  <newline>   <newline>  <newline> **6. Rational decision-making** <newline>  <newline> This can relate to the previously mentioned strength. Seeing consistency in patterns and great attention to detail can help them make the most rational decision.  <newline>  <newline>   <newline>  <newline> **7. Strong memory** <newline>  <newline> Some Autistic can have strong memory regarding facts, dates, numbers, equations, and so forth. This could help them strengthen their expertise. And for some who are interested in how people interact, this could help them remember plenty of neurotypical gestures, expressions, and phrases in dialog, which help them on masking (pretending like neurotypical). This could also enhance their encyclopedic knowledge. <newline>  <newline>   <newline>  <newline> **8. Lateral thinking** <newline>  <newline> We are often told to think outside the box, and autistic people are great at it. Autistic people tend to find unusual and novel ideas. But what makes autistic people excel at it? <newline>  <newline> It's due to the higher ability of lateral thinking. Lateral thinking is a manner of solving problems through indirect and creative approaches via reasoning that's not immediately obvious.

459;xmdduz;[DAE] Hyper-focus on a special interest until you've convinced yourself you'll never be good at it (or meet your own standards) and give up before trying?;"I used to draw. I used to paint. I looked at art others have done, and instead of doing the NT thing of adopting the styles I love and practicing to improve, I mourned my inability to be as good as the styles I enjoy and dropped it entirely in order to stop disappointing myself. I hate what I produce. I feel I have a decently objective eye, and what I produce is NOT what I see in my head. It just doesn't work. Proportion, detail, depth, perspective, anatomy, NOT A SINGLE THING translates to the page. It's especially frustrating when I can visualize ***incredibly vivid*** illustrations and animations in my mind. <newline>  <newline> It's starting to happen again. I feel like I am.. *fine*.. at painting miniatures. I'm not at a level I want to be, but I'm at a level where I'm proud of what I make. I browse pinterest when I'm inspired (past few days) and hyper-focus on styles I'd like to replicate. I feel I can analyze the painting styles and techniques pretty well. They just kind-of..  make sense to me, where drawing/art doesn't. All the perspective and depth and detail that I can't figure out how to get into a 2-dimensional image is there, I just have to add colors and simulate light.. which makes enough sense to me. I'm starting to get that weird feeling that I get with art. I'm becoming the Sisyphus of my own special interests. <newline>  <newline> I wanted to know if anyone else feels this, and if they've found ways to.. hmm.. maybe not ""fix"" it.. but at least work around it.";Cthylla11111;False;2;1.0;2022-09-23 23:59:57;/r/aspergirls/comments/xmdduz/dae_hyperfocus_on_a_special_interest_until_youve/;aspergirls

461;xkxoyk;Everything I say is wrong at all times.;"I was just diagnosed after a lifetime of being told that I'm unique/special/quirky/different/gifted/emotional. People have always said I ""operate on a different plane"" or just see things different than others. This has helped at school and in my career but I feel like it's coming to a point where I just say stupid shit all the time and no one understands what I am saying. This used to happen like once a month but now it's happening every time I open my mouth. <newline>  <newline> My therapist says it's because I don't have the ability to make the same assumptions as NT people. I also found the post here about ""Are NT people incapable of common sense?"" to be relatable. <newline>  <newline> An example from yesterday - in a Discord server I'm in for people who've been laid off from my large company, someone asked me what industries I am interviewing in that seem the most promising in terms of longevity. I said blockchain because in our greater industry - of which I have 10+ years experience more than anyone else - it IS the most promising path. Several people said ""lol"" and ""hilarious you think that has longevity"". <newline>  <newline> I think they interpreted my answer as what industries OVERALL have longevity but someone asked ME specifically what had longevity out of where I am interviewing so that's how I answered. Obviously in terms of stock price other industries are far more stable and have far more longevity. This is why I didn't answer that way....because it wasn't the question. But all the other people seemed to forget that part of the original question and pile on me. <newline>  <newline> This happens to me ALL THE TIME. Another example is I help make informative tiktok videos for my university. I was showing a fun Instagram ""hack"" and all the comments were like, ""This is cool but this does nothing for those of us that don't have instagram...."" and my thought process is, why the hell are you watching the video then? It obviously doesn't apply to you if you don't have it and I know that, so why do you not understand that? and how am I supposed to respond to that? Download Instagram and use the hack if it interests you then, or don't? <newline>  <newline> It makes me feel frustrated with everyone all the time. I asked another question in my work Discord about why our company has switched entity types several times as this is not typical the way it was done and everyone piled on again with sarcastic comments, but I have a background in tax filing and I understand entity types and had a genuine question. <newline>  <newline> # Does this happen to other people?

464;xjg37p;Was my boyfriend being mean? Was he making fun of me or trying to help? Why would he say these things?;Disclaimer: I also posted this on quora and in another thread on here because I’m afraid no one will answer me <newline>  <newline> The other day I was sitting in Red Lobster with my boyfriend. It was nice and quiet and dim. But I was having a hard day and was kinda anxious. I recently was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder but am high functioning. I have always stimmed my whole life but not always the same way. Stress and anxiety (which I also have general anxiety that I was diagnosed with as well and it seems to be pretty severe) make me stim more and in more noticeable ways. I was rocking back in forth at the restaurant but I went there because I wanted grilled fish because it makes my stomach not hurt as much as everything else and it’s quiet and there’s not a lot of people in there (at this particular red lobster). But I was still stimming, and my boyfriend started trying to say something to me and started saying “don’t take this the wrong way” and I said what do you mean? “You’re just gonna say something mean to me” I could tell because he had a certain look on his face that I’ve learned means he’s disapproving of something since I’ve been with him so long. And he said he wasn’t going to say anything, which I rebutted with “Why did you say don’t take this the wrong way then?” And he pretty much said to me that before I was diagnosed he never really noticed me rocking back and forth like that. Then he said actually I did notice when you were doing this, and started pulling on his hair rocking back and forth mimicking me crying and having a meltdown. Which really hurt my feelings. And then he said “maybe it was bad timing” so I got up to go to the restroom and he asked if I was okay. I told him I just needed to use the bathroom. But I really went to sit in the corner of the stall and cry even though I couldn’t cry at the time. It turned out it was really loud in there because of the music. So I went back to the table. I tried not to stim in front of him anymore but I felt completely embarrassed like maybe everyone was looking at me and I should not do this because it’s embarrassing. But I just had a lot of anxiety well up in me and I wanted to burst out in tears and my head had this weird feeling so I told him I was trying not to move because I was embarrassed and he didn’t like it. And he said that it was okay that I could do it and he said “look I’ll do it too” and started to basically mimic my stimming. It just felt very demoralizing and I started to feel very shameful. He kinda likes to say offhanded things to me but he also says he’s not being mean. Was my boyfriend being mean to me? Or was there a reason for him to do this. Maybe he was trying to be helpful somehow. Maybe he thought he was gonna prove I was not autistic, he had a very hard time accepting it in the first place since he used to have a pretty bad view on it.;bunbunro;False;135;0.95;2022-09-20 18:12:52;/r/aspergirls/comments/xjg37p/was_my_boyfriend_being_mean_was_he_making_fun_of/;aspergirls

466;xi7243;Why Many Inventors & Discoverers Are Autistic? 8 Autistic Strengths in Cognitive Abilities (Part 1);&#x200B: <newline>  <newline> https://preview.redd.it/ept8na6kaso91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15859ba4f198073d5655b270c2c91a6de078948f <newline>  <newline> Autistic people are often portrayed as genius individuals with specific expertise and eccentric personalities. Usually, people point out their high cognitive intelligence when talking about Autistic people's strengths and advantages. But what makes autistics different cognitively than non-autistic intelligent people? <newline>  <newline> In this video, when we mention cognitive abilities, we refer to abilities to perform mental processes associated with perception, learning, memory, awareness, understanding, reasoning, judgment, intuition, and language. <newline>  <newline> Here are 8 Autistic strengths in Cognitive Abilities which make Autistic different: <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **1. Hyperfocus** <newline>  <newline> Have you ever seen autistic can be so drawn into their work or activities for a longer time? That's because of their hyperfocus. Hyperfocus is the ability to have intense concentration or visualization on a specific activity or topic for an extended time. Hyperfocus can help a person achieve things better than one who doesn't have hyperfocus. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **2. Encyclopedic knowledge** <newline>  <newline> Autistic can have a vast and deep understanding of a specific subject, especially on their special interest. Their fixation on certain areas makes Autistics have encyclopedic knowledge and even become a professional expert in some areas. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **3. Hyper-systemizing** <newline>  <newline> Autistics may be good at analyzing and systemizing stuff. This helps Autistics understand a mechanism, as well as the system of some subjects like a machine, biology, supply chain, etc. High understanding of systemized things can help autistic people recognize the pattern, which will be mentioned following... <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **4. Pattern recognition** <newline>  <newline> Pattern recognition is a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information from memory. Strong pattern recognition helps us to <newline>  <newline> * identify some connections between occurrences and subjects which might look unrelated <newline> * recognize cause and effect of complex actions <newline> * processing complex pattern <newline>  <newline> Higher capability in these areas can result in novel ideas and solutions, which could lead to new discoveries and inventions. This pattern recognition can also detect inconsistencies in some areas, like law, morals, and norms. <newline>  <newline> Strong pattern recognition of Autistic people is also supported by their neurology. Compared with the general population, Autistic people tend to have more brain activity in temporal and occipital areas, which are brain regions associated with recognizing the pattern. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **Reference:** <newline>  <newline> https://preview.redd.it/nddsf3yhaso91.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4daf29024b3199b3cfbb7c1e2ec9ef7bf0f4ec1 <newline>  <newline> Why Many Inventors & Discoverers Are Autistic? 8 Autistic Strengths in Cognitive Abilities (Part 1) | Biociety Youtube Channel: [https://youtu.be/MWMu8lI5Ag4](https://youtu.be/MWMu8lI5Ag4);RaleighClarke;False;0;0.88;2022-09-19 09:27:54;/r/aspergirls/comments/xi7243/why_many_inventors_discoverers_are_autistic_8/;aspergirls

470;xe24v2;How do you handle social event invites from friends?;So I’ve not had to deal with this situation for a long time because of covid and also because I only have a few close friends who I see one on one (they’re not friends with each other).  <newline>  <newline> My close friend has invited me to a gathering/party at their new place, it’s a belated celebration for her and her boyfriend moving in together to a new home. As soon as I saw the Facebook invite I was filled with anxiety. It’s in the evening, Saturday night, people will be drinking and I won’t know anyone except my friend and her boyfriend (who is lovely but I’ve only met him once).  <newline>  <newline> I don’t drink and I don’t go to events like this because I never enjoy them. I used to either make up an excuse because I was too anxious to go or I’d force myself there in the hopes I’d end up enjoying myself or meeting new people but being very uncomfortable and anxious (because story of my life is my parents telling me I should just go to something because I’ll probably have fun once I’m there).  <newline>  <newline> I’m not really sure what the right thing to do is in this situation. I have come a long way in understanding my limits and when I should push myself to do something vs choose not to do it because it will do more harm than good and just not force myself into social situations that make me uncomfortable. But I am worried about offending my friend if I don’t go,  because it is really nice of her to invite me, yet at the same time showing up alone to a new place, with all new people in the evening when everyone is drinking and the literal focus is chatting to people and making small talk, fills me with anxiety and dread and I honestly can’t see how I would end up enjoying it. <newline>  <newline> How do you make decisions like this?! I find it hard to know whether I need to push myself out of my comfort zone versus listening to myself and not forcing myself into social situations with multiple factors that make me uncomfortable. <newline>  <newline> TLDR: my friend invited me to a housewarming party on a Saturday night, it’s a social situation I would struggle in and I’m anxious about what to do because I don’t want to offend my friend. I’m not sure if this is a situation where I should push myself to go or accept it’s a situation I’m not comfortable with.;Sunflowers_0419;False;8;0.75;2022-09-14 13:33:14;/r/aspergirls/comments/xe24v2/how_do_you_handle_social_event_invites_from/;aspergirls
471;xdogwv;Feeling weird about an interaction I had with a stranger last evening.;"Long story as short as possible, me and a group of friends are part of a small, mostly-private writer’s guild, and we meet up at a local cafe at least once per week. Some members live far away, so they join us via Skype or Zoom. <newline>  <newline> The reason why I say our group is “mostly private”, is because we don’t advertise ourselves as a public group (no meetup links or anything), and my friend (the one who owns the server we share our work on) has to “okay” everyone who wishes to join the group. Nobody can just willy-nilly join us or find the website, mostly to protect our privacy and publication rights.  <newline>  <newline> I ended up in this group because one of my friends in this group was my teacher for the last three semesters of high school. I have Cystic Fibrosis, and it was kicking my ass towards the end of my high school career, so I ended up finishing my diploma through a Homebound program. My friend was assigned as my Homebound teacher, and thanks to him, I got through those last three semesters without much trouble.  <newline>  <newline> My teacher really liked my writing and had other students in the writer's group, so I accepted the invitation to join and have been attending ever since. I've made lots of cool friends through the group, and we've all grown quite close to each other, especially since some of our work and discussion topics are pretty deep and personal. We critique the writing, not the writer. And, we don't tolerate people who can't do that. Nor do we tolerate plagiarism, or anger towards each other, or anything like that. Nobody's been kicked from the group for as long as I've been in it, but I've seen/heard of a couple people getting rejected when they asked my former teacher/friend to join.  <newline>  <newline> Like me, my teacher has a very sensitive sixth-sense, and is super picky about who gets to join and who doesn't. Unlike me, he isn't nearly as anxious or jumpy, so I trust his judgement a little better than my own.  <newline>  <newline> With that outta the way, about last night.  <newline>  <newline> It was just any evening in the group. Just me, my old teacher, and another friend were hanging out at the cafe, discussing a memoir piece I'd written, when some random guy around my age (around 21 or 22) who looked like he'd just been at a job interview (he was wearing a full suit) strutted on over and asked if we were a bunch of writers. He expressed that he wanted to become a writer, and had been eavesdropping on our conversation about my memoir. He wanted to know if we could help him with his writing.  <newline>  <newline> I was a little startled by how he just popped out of nowhere, but I was otherwise polite and we let him sit at our table. Because I was sitting across from my two friends at a four-seater table, the dude sat next to me and instantly started trying to lead the conversation, but my teacher quickly took hold of the reins and started to interview the dude, as we always do with potential new members. It's important that we get an idea of who we're dealing with so we don't create a hostile environment in our group. As I said, I trust my friends' judgement, especially my teacher's.  <newline>  <newline> The kid seemed a little pushy and frustrated at first. He was smiling and polite, but there was definitely some frustration emanating off of him since he couldn't gain full control of the conversation. He also claimed to have worked in IT for a little while, and if I ever needed it, he'd fix my laptop for free. I declined, and he turned back to my two friends who were staring him down like a pair of hawks.  <newline>  <newline> Still, my hackles were raised when that dude came over, because he wouldn't stop smiling and he was pretty loud and animated, like he had maxed out his charisma dial or some shit. I don't like people who are instantly charismatic like that, because I've got bad experiences with people like that. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I definitely could tell that dude wasn't exactly ""normal"" or ""normal weird"", if that makes sense.   <newline>  <newline> Again, I just sat back and let my teacher and other friend deal with this dude, because I figured I was just startled and a little too jaded. I needed to give this kid a chance to introduce himself.  <newline>  <newline> Turns out, he'd been let go from a previous job and was searching for another one while getting his nursing degree. Growing up, the guy had some issues with weed and abusive family, and he had ""a little altercation"" with an ex that landed him in juvie for a month when he was 17. But, now he was out and was working on staying out of trouble and bettering himself. Obviously, this guy's very admirable in that way, but for whatever reason, whether it was his constant smile, his attempts to take the reins in the conversation, his interest in my laptop and fixing it for me for free, or his insistence that he would be a good addition to our group, it just kept my hackles raised.  <newline>  <newline> He gave us his information afterward (he and I exchanged emails), and he shook our hands and left. But, not before trying to discreetly wink at me as he mouthed, ""Email me back."" I'm 90% sure that dude was trying to hit on me. And, my friends figured that too, and we all had a chuckle because I'm ace.  <newline>  <newline> Overall, it was a very odd and unsettling interaction. I later texted my friends detailing my concerns, and they both basically told me it's okay that I feel that way but to not worry about it too much. Weird? Yeah. Dangerous/malicious? Probably not. But, it's always good to err on the side of caution.  <newline>  <newline> For the record, I'm not afraid of this guy hurting any of us. He was a scrawny, fairly short guy, and if he was trying to manipulate us at any point, it clearly wasn't working. He just gave me weird vibes and I don't know what to really think. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but holy shit, do I want to jump to some conclusions!";camohorse;False;15;0.89;2022-09-14 01:18:40;/r/aspergirls/comments/xdogwv/feeling_weird_about_an_interaction_i_had_with_a/;aspergirls

My dad has always been a serial cheater (hence all the siblings) and because one of my sisters has a severely autistic son (non-verbal with some other challenges) and I’m, to quote an aunt, “wild and difficult”, the family has decided to blame any differences on an ex-wife cursing him.  <newline>  <newline> I’m reminded again of my black sheep status when I found out yet another relative, this one a cousin I grew up with, got married without even telling me, never mind inciting me. That’s the 11th wedding I’ve found out about through Facebook. Yea, I’m keeping count. Truthfully, the idea of attending some boring, traditional Catholic ceremony bores me to tears, but it would be nice to be invited.  <newline>  <newline> It’s taken almost 30 years, but it’s finally starting to sink in: 95% of my family wants nothing to do with me because they think I’m possessed by demons (no, really, I was told this when I was 14yo), overly sensitive, chaotic (had some wicked tantrums as a kid), and just someone to be avoided. I’m tired of trying at this point.  <newline>  <newline> *Sigh* Posting b/c I’m in my feelings (another cousin got engaged and I doubt I’ll be even thought of) and just struggling with being utterly alone in a MASSIVE family. My only shiny happy thought is that my memoir is going to slap and no stones will be left unturned *smiling*.  <newline>  <newline> Sorry for the long post and the 800 parentheses.;Demi_J;False;2;1.0;2022-09-10 02:04:01;/r/aspergirls/comments/xad4lz/struggling_to_deal_with_superstitious_family_that/;aspergirls
475;xad0te;Wanting to help people in suffering + when does a sib's SO become family?;I just had a conversation with my brother about his boyfriend. Not sharing what triggered the conversation but essentially the discussion is the following: <newline>  <newline> I feel that if he's his boyfriend, he's supposed to be part of my family. To like him, and welcome him, I have to think of him well. <newline>  <newline> If my brother talks about him a lot I will feel more emotionally connected to him. And I'm excited to add someone new to my family. But we haven't met except once and exchanged like 3 messages on Instagram in their 6 months or 7 or something of being together. <newline>  <newline> My brother isn't comfortable that I message the bf for some things that are more sensitive. This makes me feel excluded. I understand. But I also don't.  <newline>  <newline> Because I'm just wondering here. If I hear about him, how ever will I be with him eithout biases? <newline>  <newline> If they break up, then it makes sense for me to not be involved. But if he gets in my life, why can't I talk with him? I understand the reasoning. But I don't understand the mechanics. Like, do I only get to chat with him when he's visited 3 times? 4? 5? Add on... What are the rules? Hoe do we figure this out?  <newline>  <newline> I'm being asked to not get in his life as much (fair: his friends are his friends, mine are mine) but he's his boyfriend and I hear about him so if things go well I can't act like just an acquaintance.

478;x8l44x;Social slills relating to getting a puppy;I’m 22, and have always wanted a dog. I’ve never lived somewhere I could, and I didn’t have dogs growing up. I’ve been working towards getting myself into a living situation that would allow me to be able to have a dog.  <newline>  <newline> Well, I bought a house. I scored a work from home job. I am now in the process of looking at potential avenues of getting said dog.  <newline>  <newline> I don’t want this post to start a fight about adopt don’t shop. I agree. Adoption and rescues are wonderful and I whole heartedly was prepared to walk into a shelter and adopt a dog that way.  <newline>  <newline> However, I’m looking into it, I’m afraid of taking on a dog with too advanced of needs/behaviors for me as a first time dog owner. I’ve been thinking about getting a dog from a breeder that is incredibly reputable near me.  <newline>  <newline> They’re a Golden Retriever breeder with incredible reviews and their dogs look beautiful, well cared for, and responsibly bred.

I don’t want a dog until next year (like around this time) but I want a lot of time to prepare and gather information so I can provide the best home and care for my dog.  <newline>  <newline> What should I ask the breeder?

479;x3lnyj;40+ Years Old and Obsessed with old TV Show from my Preteen Years, Nickelodeon's Fifteen;"I just posted a confession that I'm obssessed with this show, but then I realized it's actually a special interest and probably belongs in this forum. <newline>  <newline> I can't stop thinking about this show that I've loved ever since I was 12 - Nickelodeon's Fifteen, or Hillside in Canada.  I used to have the whole series on VHS, then I bought it on DVD a long time ago. I even had my late husband and ex boyfriend watch it with me. My husband got into it with me, surprisingly, but my ex boyfriend thought it was melodramatic and weird. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, there is a couple on the show that I'm obsessed with. Their character names are ""Matt"" and ""Ashley,"" and I was so obsessed with them as a preteen, that I even named my jacket MattAndAshley. I remember stimming (rocking back and forth) on the couch chanting that I wanted Matt and Ashley to get back together. Then it happened. I even skipped Father's Day at my grandparents' house just to watch that episode. I still remember. I was recording it on VHS but I had to stay and watch it ""live."" <newline>  <newline> After all these years, sometimes I find the clip of Matt and Ashley getting back together in Season 3, episode 13, and I replay the clip until I blush. I feel all squirmy watching them confess their feelings for each other, and being all bashful and dancing. It's so wholesome and it just makes me giddy. <newline>  <newline> I've always thought that ""Ashley"" (played by Laura Harris) is my ideal version of a woman and ""Matt"" (played by Todd Talbot) is my ideal man. ""Matt"" was actually my first crush and pretty much Ashley too. <newline>  <newline> I know how weird this sounds, but I still think about my favorite episodes and try to imagine how Matt and Ashley would be today if they were real characters who got married in real life and had a family. Thinking about that makes me feel good. <newline>  <newline> There are lesser shows that also make me feel this way but not to this extent. I have my character couples that I love like Melrose Place's ""Billy and Alison,"" Dawson Creek's ""Dawson and Joey,"" and several other sitcom/soap couples. I have this theme of friends turning lovers or couples reconciling that I used to write about, think about, and look for in shows and books. <newline>  <newline> The funny thing is I'm not even into celebrity culture. Modern culture repels me, and I don't care about celebrities in general. But several years ago, I actually Facebook messaged the character who played ""Matt,"" and I was overjoyed when he actually responded to me with a friendly message about it. <newline>  <newline> I'm not sure how common this is, but I want to share it with people who understand more than just confessing it to strangers!";Brilliant_Version667;False;4;1.0;2022-09-01 23:15:31;/r/aspergirls/comments/x3lnyj/40_years_old_and_obsessed_with_old_tv_show_from/;aspergirls
480;x3bzl2;How to approach following and messaging the Instagram account of a guy I met briefly in person without it seeming weird (Social scripting help)?;"TLDR: There was this guy working at my local farmer's market who seemed cool, but we only met briefly. He wasn't from the U.S. and went back home a couple of weeks ago. I'm considering following him and reaching out in hopes of befriending him, but based on the context of how I found his account I need help figuring out a socially appropriate approach. I'm 24F and autistic/ADHD. <newline>  <newline> I started going to a local farmer's market a few weeks ago. One of the stands I went up to had two guys working there — I’ll call them A and T. We had a brief interaction and I was surprised to hear A had a British accent. A seemed cool but I'm shy when I go up to vendors, so it was very cut-and-dry on my end. I got what I wanted from the stand and didn't say much more. I went back this past weekend and T was working alone at the stand. Turns out A was a friend he'd invited to work at the farm for a month, but he'd gone back to London. <newline>  <newline> I follow the farm's Instagram account. The other day T made a post on the farm’s account saying he’s doing a takeover, introducing himself and tagging his personal account. I clicked through to his personal account and saw he'd *just* posted a photo dump thanking the people who’d recently helped at the stand. His caption thanked A, tagged him in a few photos, and mentioned his account. I checked out A’s account and saw he's a musician. Music is my life, I'm heavily invested in my local scene and underground music. He also seems to be heavily involved in his local scene back home. I wished I'd interacted with him more in person because I love connecting with people over music and could see us potentially getting along. I'm debating following him and reaching out. I feel like his account being tagged gives somewhat of an opening (?) but I'm trying to figure out how to go about it in the most socially appropriate way possible. Here's where I'm stuck... <newline>  <newline> A) The recent post on the farm's main account directs to T's page, but I don't follow T. Following A from T's post may appear odd if I don't follow T. Maybe following T first, then A would be better... but I'm not sure if that's doing too much. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, but their accounts are public so it might be okay? <newline>  <newline> B) **(This is the one I need help with the most)** If I do follow and message A, I need some help figuring out what to say to him. I want it to come across as natural as possible and I'm not always good at that. I feel like I should message him so he's aware of how I found him. I highly doubt he'd recognize me from our brief interaction a few weeks ago, since I was wearing sunglasses and a mask. Making myself known could be a good way to initiate conversation, otherwise I'd probably look like a random follower and we wouldn't interact. He seems extroverted so he may be open to someone reaching out to him. My main problem with socializing is that I don't know how to organize what I want to say casually and concisely. I want to say *something* to him but I don't want it to end up being too intense or creepy in any way. It's really hard for me not to be detailed, and I know some people find that intense. I don't really do well with just a general idea of what to say and need help with an actual script because I don't do well with just a general idea of what to say. I don't want to say, ""I saw you were tagged in T's post"" because it could give the false impression that I know T when I don't, etc. etc. <newline>  <newline> Thanks to anyone who read until the end!";beyondtheleaves;False;3;1.0;2022-09-01 16:27:32;/r/aspergirls/comments/x3bzl2/how_to_approach_following_and_messaging_the/;aspergirls

Also I dislike scrolling through shorts (or tik tok, instagram, whatever social media you use) because they use the most horrendous background music (currently popular boom-boom music) that tends to be loud and again, disturbing.

484;wyrcad;DAE have a “squeal/grunt” language with their partner or friends?;I looked through the subreddit to see if anyone had answered this question before, and it has been answered, but I hope it’s okay that I want to see new responses and so I created this thread. <newline>  <newline> I squeal and grunt a lot to convey emotion. I also like to make words with it. It’s soothing and comforting to me. This will probably be way too much information but I’m so curious to see what kind of languages everyone else has come up with with their friends or partners, so I want to describe it as best as I can. <newline>  <newline> For every long-term partner I’ve had, I’ve always come up with some kind of sound particular to them spontaneously. My first boyfriend’s sound was “EEE”, squealed. My second was “GIGIGIGI”, squealed. And my husband’s is currently “GLIIB”, evolved from just “GIIB”, without the L.  <newline>  <newline> Most names I give to pets end up spontaneously changing as well. For example, my cat’s name is Kibby, but I ended up calling him “Kibbeim”, and then “Beim”, and then “Beimerton Beim”. (Try explaining this to people when you’re trying to tell them your pet’s name. I seem like a loon!) <newline>  <newline> Please write down below if you have languages like this and tell me all about them! I want to know more aspergirls!! <newline>  <newline> Edit: I also like to make jingles with my cat. I sing him songs that consist of only saying the words “Beimerton Beim”, while clicking my tongue, etc. And sometimes I dance and pet him to the rhythm. I love doing that! It feels so good from a sensory perspective. <newline>  <newline> Edit 2: Here’s an example of how I talk to my cat. Please don’t laugh at me! Also, I have COVID, that’s why I sound sick. I’m doing well with it. https://youtube.com/shorts/xfG6gJd2WRY?feature=share <newline>  <newline> Edit 3: The Beimerton Beim song and the word I use with my husband: https://youtube.com/shorts/OiiYioswq7U?feature=share <newline>  <newline> Edit 4: Good morning ladies. I just wanted to say, thank you all for coming to chat. It is beautiful to see you all open up and you’re all so very full of love. Thank you so much for sharing parts of your life with me. Hold on to everything you cherish! The world isn’t as bad as the media wants it to seem. I will respond to each of you individually, if that’s okay, but I need some time. I just woke up.  <newline>  <newline> I was thinking of this because I dipped into another subreddit to show my autistic love for a game called Story of Seasons: PoOT. But the reaction there was nothing compared to the surge of love I felt here. You girls have really made me feel so special by coming on here and sharing some goofy sounds. Thank you all, genuinely, for making my day better. You’re all incredible girls. <newline>  <newline> Edit 5: I can’t remember if I added it in this thread or another one, but I really like the aspergirls banner color. It’s so nice on my eyes. I’m so happy there are people out there who consider that bright colors might hurt my eyes. Thank you for existing and caring. <newline>  <newline> Edit 6: I’m going to take a break from Reddit for a while because I am feeling overwhelmed and I want to go play Story of Seasons. Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing. It’s just that when I get burnt out, I start to mask, and I have a hard time being myself. However, you all have shown me so much love and support and I feel so wholly accepted for who I am. This thread is full of angels. You’re all so cared about and loved. Take care, my friends. Stay together!! Love above everything. <newline>  <newline> Edit 7: I’m so excited about all of the little languages I’ve learned from everyone that I want to add some more vocabulary I use between me, my husband, and my cat: <newline>  <newline> Skettied (derived from upsetty-spaghetti. Pronounced skeh-tead) We use this to playfully describe being upset by something <newline>  <newline> Pibba (pronounced pee-bah) to describe pizza <newline>  <newline> Belbel (like the bel in “belly”) Often used in baby voice when I’m tickling my husband or my cat is rolling to show me his stomach <newline>  <newline> Comf (like comf in comfortable) To describe being comfortable <newline>  <newline> Hung/humgee (for hunger) I ask my cat this constantly. “Are you hung?” <newline>  <newline> Memnergy nink (pronounced a little grumbled like mem-ner-gee) for energy drink <newline>  <newline> Speeby/sleebeim (pronounced spee-beam/sluh-beam) for sleepy <newline>  <newline> Ye ye ye/no no no in a baby voice when I’m excited <newline>  <newline> Peebs (for please) also in baby voice  <newline>  <newline> “Dere him gooo” when I serve cat’s food to him.  <newline>  <newline> Okay, if you made it through the encyclopedia, I genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, THANK you. I needed to feel accepted and everyone has helped me feel so normal and sane. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <newline>  <newline> P.S. this is the last edit, but my mom is also on the spectrum. She has always run around the house and said odd phrases repeatedly, for as long as I can remember. My name also became “Nick” and “Bel/Belly” to her (my name is Shelby). <newline>  <newline> TL:DR Autistic women are incredible. I adore you all. So much light and love to every single person who reads this. Goodbye and good luck! Message me any time if you ever need emotional support. I am training to become a therapist and it gives me genuine pleasure to make people happy. <newline>  <newline> The internet is an incredible tool that I’m so thankful for.

485;wx9uxd;How much social interaction is enough?; <newline> Hi, this is going to be a whole story, so sorry if it's too boring, but maybe someone can relate... so I read somewhere that 6 hours a day is a min. requirement for how much social interaction humans need for a healthy mental state. Well... I am at around 0.5, some days I get hours, some days none. A few days ago I came to work and started speaking with a kind of rusty voice and I realised I haven't spoken in two days.  <newline>  <newline> From childhood to 19 I had really enjoyed being alone. I played with other kids and I enjoyed it but I never minded being alone, at home I would mostly play alone. In school I would have my friend group and I would talk to them but outside of school I was mostly alone, or with family. My family is also quiet a lot.  <newline>  <newline> From 20 to 28, I was in constant contact with people almost all day. It was facebook, boyfriends, work as a waitress, new people, parties, everything. I almost drowned in social interaction and other people's stuff, stopped doing what I liked before, and completely lost myself. All the time I was thinking how great it would be to spend some alone time, in the back of my head, but I got so hooked on people that I couldn't do it (Codependency issues). <newline>  <newline> Then 2 years ago I had a mental break/severe burn out, break up, left my job, everything. I was in a really dark place and started working on myself, discovered I was autistic. I got a diagnosis this February.  <newline>  <newline> I moved into my own place in January. Here I am alone with my dog and I finally spend a lot of time alone. I am slowly working on becoming more creative, and going back to what I love. I do watch a lot of netflix (I used to love shows, then right before burn out I hadn't watched anything in a year, like, literary not even one movie, there was no escape, and I need escape), I play video games, I tried drawing again and reading after years (!!) of not reading one book (used to read all day when in my teens), I started a puzzle yesterday... getting there. Self work is great. <newline>  <newline> But I miss people. I miss them but I get tired only thinking about contacting them. Many people want to see me, I actually have friends and people I could talk to. I think I need interaction, but I now know that I can't talk about small talk anymore because I will get tired as hell after 15min and I don't want to bother people with my rambling. Other thing is, in a way I think I am still 'detoxing' from all the interaction, I am kind of still hooked on it. I catch myself thinking about people or having imaginary conversations with them, because I was sooo used to doing it for 10 years.  <newline>  <newline> I don't know what to do. I dream about black holes and feel like I am falling into one sometimes, I feel I will miss out on life and I get depressed but I think this is societal pressure, like I learned you need to constantly interact, even if that is not what I really need, I need my interests. I tried therapy, doesn't do much because I am very self-aware and I know about psychology, I just have no mental strenght or something (also I literary can't make myself go talk to a therapist again, I get dead tired only thinking about it, and I do talk about struggles with my friends).  <newline>  <newline> Does anyone feel similarly? How much social interaction do you get a day, how much do you think is enough? I think 6 hours is maybe ment for NT people... sorry for the long post I need to write this...;katiasan;False;4;1.0;2022-08-25 09:50:01;/r/aspergirls/comments/wx9uxd/how_much_social_interaction_is_enough/;aspergirls
486;wwxk5o;Tattoo artist ghosted me with incomplete back piece;Around seven years ago I was getting a huge back piece tattoo.

487;wwtkkd;Social isolation since childhood. Making friends as an adult seems impossible, is a relationship the only option?; I'm in my late 20s and haven't had a friend since I was 12. I developed severe anxiety at that age and became isolated. My interests have kept me alive. I didn't even have online friends and didn't dare to participate in any online communities. <newline>  <newline> For the last year or so my anxiety hasn't been completely debilitating, but I don't know where to start. It's strange. I have no idea how to make or maintain friendships. <newline>  <newline> I don't have a job and only recently started studying to a small extent (my mental health put a stop to this many years ago). <newline>  <newline> How do you make friends as an adult in this situation? <newline>  <newline> I've never had a romantic relationship either. It's something that feels completely alien to me and I hadn't even considered until recently, though I always wished I had friends. <newline>  <newline> I like the idea of romantic relationships but can't actually imagine myself in one. I'd prefer to have a close friend instead. Something lasting. <newline>  <newline> I have the impression that a lot of women with ASD have their SO as their only friend and are content with that. Friendships seem much harder to make, and it only gets harder the older you get. <newline>  <newline> A relationship seems like the only option since I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I've been wondering if I should try, even if it feels wrong. I have zero sex drive which would make it impossible - I had it in my early teens but not since, I'm less depressed but it hasn't come back. Maybe I can feel something if I get to know someone and manage to feel comfortable with him. But I don't want to hurt anyone and I fear that some men will think that I tricked them and owe them. I fear that I will attract abusive types who think I'm vulnerable and gullible. <newline>  <newline> There are other problems - I never want to live with anyone ever again, for instance.

489;wv1n6l;Autism and Heart Rate Variability;I've been using my boyfriend's old Oura ring that happens to fit me (on only one finger 😬) to track my sleep just out of curiosity. Everything looked surprisingly good until realizing that a low HRV is actually bad. HRV is heart rate variability and apparently measures how well someone's heart can handle a variety of situations. If your HRV is high it means your heart can kind of bounce back from stressors quickly and that you have a healthy nervous system (from what I understand). It also does depend a lot on the individual and your personal average score is more important than an arbitrary number, but overall low is bad and high is better. Mine is only around 20 which according to those parameters is absolute trash. <newline>  <newline> I was wondering why this might be and remembered that autistic people have [less flexible nervous systems](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChFQaNHLE5Y/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). They also tend to have higher resting heart rates. I googled autism and hrv, and there have indeed been studies showing that autistic people tend to have lower HRVs! I wanted to share this here since I think it's interesting information and if anyone is a hypochondriac like me you can maybe be slightly reassured that if you also have a low HRV (and a high heart rate) this is typical for us.;fixationed;False;15;0.99;2022-08-22 18:44:05;/r/aspergirls/comments/wv1n6l/autism_and_heart_rate_variability/;aspergirls
490;wuusy8;For those of you who live outside the US, what is it like to be autistic in your culture?;"I recently watched a TikTok where it was stated that the bubbly, enthusiastic persona that's encouraged in American workplaces, especially in women, is considered a little ridiculous and unnecessary in the French workplace. In a similar vein, I saw a comment from an individual a while back on a different sub stating that it was much easier for them to ""pass"" as a non-autistic person in their parents' home country of Russia than in the US, because Russians don't have many extroverted cultural habits such as smiling to strangers, making (mostly) insincere small talk, etc. On the other hand, there are other countries where being visibly autistic can be a very difficult and even dangerous thing, as there is not a lot of disability education and minimal resources available. <newline>  <newline> This sub, like most of reddit, tends to be pretty US-centric, so I'm curious to know what being autistic is like in different countries. Obviously, different family/workplace dynamics, different social classes, and one's own personal autistic traits can vary wildly and can massively impact one's perspective, but with that in mind, I still think it would be valuable to see different perspectives.";chesapeake_ripperz;False;25;1.0;2022-08-22 14:15:42;/r/aspergirls/comments/wuusy8/for_those_of_you_who_live_outside_the_us_what_is/;aspergirls

493;wtdut2;Sensory issues in showers?;Okay so I'm on a throwaway account for this bc I will be mentioning things that could potentially embarrass me? I hope I won't get judged for this :(  <newline>  <newline> First off I will start by saying that I didn't know which sub to post this on, because sensory issues usually are associated with autism, but I'm not sure if I even have autism (I suspect I have OCD though, which can also cause sensory issues) so I really hope that it is okay that I'm posting here. <newline>  <newline> So now to the potentially embarrassing part - I haven't showered in a month. I feel dirty and disgusting but I can't bring myself to do it. My mom said that if you even walk past my room you can smell me, and that it's unhygienic etc. The problem is, I HATE the feeling of water on my skin. I hate pools & beaches as well. It's everything about showering. Finding the right temperature, the water on my skin, scrubbing my body with a wash cloth, the cold after getting out of the shower, putting on clothes when my body is still moist & looking at my body in the mirror that is infront of the shower (this likely is associated with body dysmorphophobia, bc I have an eating disorder as well and looking at my body gives me severe anxiety) <newline> And my hair... oh my hair. I have 3c, maybe even 4a type hair and it is SO hard to take care of. I grew up in a country where my hair is uncommon and there are barely products to handle it. I love my hair, but I can't take care of it :/  <newline>  <newline> If I don't shower, I atleast try to wipe my body with wet wipes & a bit of shampoo but apparently that doesn't do much. I feel dirty and disgusting, and seeing people on tiktok ridicule people who don't shower every day makes me feel bad.  <newline>  <newline> So my question is, even if I may not have autism, does anyone have any tips on how I can fix this?? How do I overcome these feelings? <newline>  <newline> EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that I've always been this way, ever since I was a kid I HATED showers amd anything that had to do with water;throwawayacc0unthaha;False;9;1.0;2022-08-20 18:22:32;/r/aspergirls/comments/wtdut2/sensory_issues_in_showers/;aspergirls
494;wsej54;Best travel destinations or vacations for sensory avoidant?;I have spent my whole life wanting to travel to Europe, but always too terrified. <newline>  <newline> I finally do not feel as scared, however I am struggling finding a place to go that will fit my needs and also be enjoyable and not a waste of a lot of money. <newline>  <newline> I also have a walking disability so places with lots of walking/hiking/hills etc. with bad public transportation is a no-no. I have anxiety as well but will be with my husband who is my support. He is like me as far as what he wants in a vacation. <newline>  <newline> Visually I enjoy the architecture of Edinburgh, Scotland: Paris and Colmar in France: and the villas and lake in Varenna in Lake Como, Italy. I was also maybe thinking about London… <newline> We do not like heat or beaches. We only like to travel in off seasons. <newline>  <newline> BUT HERE IS MY ISSUE: I hate crowds. I hate hustle and bustle. I live near NYC and absolutely loath it (except Central Park and MET Museum I love). I am afraid that I will book a trip to London and Paris and be absolutely overwhelmed by the city and crowds and trying to get around and it will be a horrible trip and waste of a lot of money and that I would get sick and have meltdowns etc. i am not even mentioning my fears at airport or plane for 10+ hours. I cant spend hours away from my “home base” either, I get too overstimulated or feel sick or exhausted. <newline>  <newline> As far as Edinburgh or Italy, I am afraid of the hills/walking or being disappointed. <newline> As far as Colmar, France, it is impossible to get to and only worth a two day trip maybe so it isn’t possible unless I go to Paris. <newline>  <newline> So I have spent the last month hyperfixated to the point of exhaustion and tears trying to figure out what to do. My autism is holding me back, my physical disability is holding me back, I have not even mentioned my food intolerances that make things even harder. <newline>  <newline> Instagram and travel bloggers give me such FOMO and make these places look amazing but what if the reality is awful? What if I can’t handle it? <newline>  <newline> Edit to add more thoughts: I would have less of an issue with all of this if I lived in Europe or the UK and the trip wouldn’t cost so much/be so far, but coming from NY and having to spend extra for business class flights (helps with my disabilities compared to economy for such a long flight) it is so expensive and I can’t justify $15k trip that gives me the worst autistic meltdown of my life while being so far away from home for up to 2 weeks LOL 😂 this also might be my only ever trip abroad, you never know what life brings and I may never be able to do such a thing again! The last three years taught me that with covid and with my own physical illness/disability that happened. <newline>  <newline> Any advice?

497;woho3m;Why is making friends so hard? Very discouraged;I posted this in another Autism community, but I would love some more femme input as well.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I’m in my mid 20s and coming to terms with a possible late life diagnosis . I’ve gotten a referral to a psychiatrist, and I’m waiting to hear back but all the signs are there . My whole life I’ve struggled to make friends. In adulthood , it’s gotten marginally easier , partially due to the fact a lot of people I’ve met are also either on the spectrum or neurodivergent in some way . But I’m starting to notice a pattern .  <newline>  <newline> People enter my life as if they want to be my friend , but ignore me when I make attempts. I moved to a  city and a lot of the locals friend requested me . I’m a local artist so I’m a semi prominent face in the scene. I have met a few of these individuals face to face but others are still strangers despite being in the same city . I’ve had a few things happen  <newline>  <newline> 1. An established friend group I hung out with once or twice asked to come to one of my shows . I gave them details , we had a whole fun weekend planned . They all dropped the night before because they “didn’t have money” but went out with eachother the same night, and continue to go out with eachother almost every weekend despite their finances . I don’t know what happened but I wish they just would’ve been honest about no longer wanting to engage with me. My feelings are still hurt because I can’t figure out what went wrong .  <newline>  <newline> 2. A lot of these locals interact with me on Facebook , heavily . They’re always talking about being open to meeting new people and making friends . They’ll comment on my posts in ways that make it seem like they’re open to friendship but when I initiate , they go silent .  <newline> 3. I reached out to a girl because one of our mutuals i DO keep in touch with told me she’s looking to make more queer POC friends in the area . I reached out, introduced myself , explained the connection . She hasn’t responded in close to 2 weeks but is still very active online and still interacting with my posts/content .  <newline>  <newline> Amongst other things . I don’t want to take any of these things personal because I truly don’t know these people and everybody is going through their own struggles . I also know not everyone has the spoons to respond to messages all the time, myself included . I just feel like there’s some kind of unspoken social cue everyone’s aware of but me. I try not to take it personal because a lot of people in your mid 20s are temporary, autism or not but my self esteem is really starting to take a tremendous hit . I’m constantly told that I’m an amazing conversationalist and very easy going (years of masking) so if that’s the case, why do I feel like it’s me?;CocoaBeanPiscesQueen;False;7;1.0;2022-08-14 21:46:43;/r/aspergirls/comments/woho3m/why_is_making_friends_so_hard_very_discouraged/;aspergirls

500;wm0hr5;A Resource: Avoiding A Diagnosis of Anything But Autistic;"We created a resource to share with professionals, those working to get diagnosed, and anyone else in our lives looking to learn about what it means to be autistic. During the diagnosis process, we're often told we have anything but autism. Many people get a long list of diagnoses and still don't feel like any fit. <newline>  <newline> TL:DR at the bottom. <newline>  <newline> We’re a two person team. We (Raven and A.C.) both experienced being diagnosed with “Anything but Autism,” getting handed a list of diagnoses and still feeling like it wasn’t right. We noticed we’re not the only ones being invalidated. We’ve thought ""anything but autistic"" for every post or tweet we’ve seen about another person who was exhausted by not being diagnosed because they make eye contact or feel emotion. Recently, A.C. made a comment saying: ""I wanna start an Anything But Autism campaign that calls out all the professionals (and otherwise) who are willing to diagnose anything except autism unless you're their perfect idea of autistic. I'm trying to get diagnosed right now and I've seen so many posts like this. They'd really rather diagnose us with 8 things than realize autistic people are unique human beings."" <newline>  <newline> The response was strong enough that we started thinking of how we could make it happen. Raven had shared a Notion page about a month earlier that was so informative, A.C. reached out to collab! We wanted action items and a goal, so it starts with spreading the resource. We're creating the all-in-one autism resource. The goal is to empower other autistic folks to share it with professionals, friends, family, coworkers, and anyone else who may not understand what it means to be actually autistic. This way it goes beyond just ""raising awareness"" and includes the actionable item of changing the narrative in the medical community and making diagnosis easier. <newline>  <newline> We still have work to do on the resource! We want to include stories from other autistic people who struggled (or are struggling) through the diagnostic process. There's information at r/AnythingButAutistic if you'd like to be included! <newline>  <newline> TL:DR: It's common for autistic people to get diagnosed as Anything But Autistic.

504;wipw99;I am happy that my relationship with one of my special interests is much healthier than when I was younger. (Trigger Warning: Suicidal Thoughts and Self Harm.);One of my special interests is in manga (as well as anime, light novels, webtoons, comics, cartoons, manhwa, manhua, and donghua). This special interest began when I was 7 years old and my relationship with this special interest was unhealthy for many years. I was very obsessive. I had suicidal thoughts and would self harm when my family members would throw away my manga and turn off my TV or internet. When my family would do this, it felt as if I was dying as they were taking away the only things that made me happy. Manga allowed me to escape from the emotional and physical abuse of my family members as well as from the bullying and ostracization I experienced at school. I can genuinely say that manga was the only reason I was alive between the ages 9 and 13 years old. When I was 13 years old I was clinically diagnosed with my mental illnesses and began to take medications. I still relied heavily on my special interest in manga but over time my relationship with this special interest improved. When I was 15 years old, I developed healthy friendships (I previously had unhealthy friendships) with other people who were neurodivergent and belonged to the LGBTQIA+ community. When I was 17 years old, I adopted my cat Amber who is now my emotional support animal. When I was 18 years old, I cut contact with my family members that emotionally and physically abused. Except for my sister, the family members that I am in contact with are not supportive of me cutting contact with certain family members, taking medications, and caring for myself via sensory tools (fidgets, plushies, ear plugs, noise reducing headsets) despite the very noticeable benefits to my emotional stability as well as mental health. I am happy that my current relationship with manga is now healthy as it is no longer something that I “need” and it lifts my mood as well as allows me to connect with other people who enjoy manga in real life and on discord.;AndiAndroid7;False;4;1.0;2022-08-07 20:57:28;/r/aspergirls/comments/wipw99/i_am_happy_that_my_relationship_with_one_of_my/;aspergirls
505;wiojav;Forget conditional friendships, I just realised I understand conditional old colleague relationships even less!;I’ve gotten to an age and an understanding of why I have zero friends - I don’t partake in conditional friendships where I ask for nothing yet I’m only there when something is needed.  <newline>  <newline> Yet it must be such an NT thing to do. The number of times I receive a LinkedIn message from an old colleague with exactly the same message is hilarious! <newline>  <newline> I just got an email saying I have a LinkedIn message and without even opening it I know what the message will say. It will go along the lines of: <newline>  <newline> 1. Greeting - “*Hi <name>*” <newline>  <newline> 2. False inquiry into how I am as clearly neither of us cares given no contact up until this point. “*How are you?*” <newline>  <newline> 3. A non-embarrassed statement of recognising how long it has been since we last spoke. “*It’s been a while*” <newline>  <newline> 4. Now we start to get down to the conditional nature of the relationship. An unspoken jib that I’ll never break the glass ceiling (not that I want to), let alone the seniority they have. “*How are you progressing with <insert details of job*?” <newline>  <newline> 5. The veiled brag, the promotion. “*I’m starting the same process at my new company*” <newline>  <newline> 6. Now the hit, the true meaning for the message.  The realisation that they have blagged the interview for a role they are not qualified for, so they want to connect in the hope I give them answers (like I would do when we worked together) “*We should connect sometime*” <newline>  <newline> The competent people I’ve worked with don’t message me, only those who would use me when we worked together, and hope they can continue to use me when they leave to further their careers.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve responded to so many of these messages I know the format they take.

510;we19fk;Coping with heartbreak;CW: mentions of child SA <newline>  <newline> Hi! I recently discovered I'm on the spectrum and it made me go easier on myself on why I'm so petrified of forming deep connections with people. I had the pattern of moving around a lot when I was a kid and never had a stable friend group. I changed from school to school, country to country, etc. I had friends I loved dearly and spent time with but then I would move away or change schools. Not to mention I developed trust issues after I had to come to terms with the fact that some people took sexually advantage of me when I was a kid and I had 0 idea on what was going on. <newline>  <newline> 5 years ago I moved to a new city again and made friends at work. As much as I loved them, my job was absolutely miserable and I quit. I started living with my partner in a nearby city, and since the pandemic I can't afford visiting my new friends as often.  <newline>  <newline> That's why a lot of my friendships were online but because the internet is an unpredictable place, no one stuck for very long. My constant moving around made me lose focus so all I can really do is keep up with my old friends through Facebook notifications.  <newline>  <newline> Because of my lifestyle and my autism, I'm pretrified of making new friends because I'm scared of being heartbroken again. My partner and my sister are the only people I regularly talk to and experience stuff with (and my sister currently lives in another country). Any tips on how to know how to trust again? I started trauma therapy for the first time ever but I just wanted to know if someone else has felt the same or experienced something similar! <newline>  <newline> TL DR: I moved around a lot so it's hard for me to mantain close friendships.;MaeMacabre;False;1;0.81;2022-08-02 03:41:21;/r/aspergirls/comments/we19fk/coping_with_heartbreak/;aspergirls

512;w8o5au;Was the thing I said offensive?;"So recently I was playing online games with 2 other people. I kept on losing and at one point I randomly left the game for a while to watch some Youtube videos and so on, without saying anything. One of the people I played with asked me whether I got mad, and I answered ""no, why?"", then the person said ""because I know you"" (I was known for getting very mad during gaming before). So then I said, like partly joking and partly being honest, ""you knew me before our high school graduation, but not after"".  <newline> I was sure this solved the issue, but I noticed these 2 people didn't really invite me after that, and the person I told this to was a bit so-so about gaming with me. So today I decided to talk to this person about that situation, and it turned out that they didn't find the thing I said about graduation nice, and this was one of the main reasons they didn't want to talk to me. <newline>  <newline> So like obviously this one person found it offensive... but is this like a general consensus for people?

523;vpq932;Self-Care Saturday!;"  <newline> Happy weekend everybody! Let's spend some time to refocus ourselves on the self-care we probably neglected this week because of commitments like school, work, family, and so on. <newline>  <newline> Take some time out for yourself today and tomorrow! Remember that you matter, and be extra kind and mindful in taking care of your own mind and body and living environment. Take some time to tidy up your habitat! Surround yourself with a happy living space that's set up exactly how you like it. So you can relax instead of feeling guilty about not having the spoons to take care of it all week. <newline>  <newline> Timers are your friend! Your very very best friend! If a task seems super daunting, then set a short timer, and start doing the thing. When the time's up, you've accomplished a goal! We've added suggestions below, to help get you going: modify those to your own liking. You'll be amazed what you can get done in 2 minutes. Because you're awesome like that.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks and success stories with the rest of the community! We're proud of you for taking some time today to take care of yourself and your space!!! Every little bit counts, and every act of self-care helps! Spoons are hard to come by some days (or most days), so let's use them wisely. <newline>  <newline> Here are some to-do things you can accomplish today by investing yourself, into yourself, and reaping the benefits all throughout the week. <newline>  <newline> Today, please remember to: <newline>  <newline> 1. DRINK WATER. Pour yourself a big glass and sip on that over the next hour until it's all gone. <newline>  <newline> 2. BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Remember to not eat anything, and don't drink anything except water for 30 minutes afterwards. Replace your toothbrush this weekend (or add it to your shopping list) if yours is older and showing signs of being worn out. If you hate your toothbrush and it's not doing a good job, find one you like! Maybe even try an electric one or sonic one that makes brushing easier, but make sure the speed/intensity are adjustable to prevent a sensory nightmare. If you hate mint toothpaste, look for different flavors. It's fine. There are no rules, only clean teeth, as best as you can manage!  <newline>  <newline> 3. FLOSS YOUR TEETH. If you don't like floss string, that's ok. Use a plastic pre-strung flosser if that's easier. Or those tiny brushes to get in the spaces between your teeth. Buy a water flosser. It doesn't matter. Floss however best you can manage. If you're not sure how flossing works, do a Google search for a tutorial. It's fine to not know things. No shame in that game! It's never too late to learn a new skill! <newline>  <newline> 4. CLEAN YOUR WHOLE BODY. Take a shower. Take a bubble bath. If being wet and cold all over your body is a sensory nightmare, then grab a washcloth and bar of soap, and give yourself a thorough spongebath, one body section at a time. There are no rules: just get clean. You are absolutely encouraged to make this as fun for yourself as possible by playing music in the shower, bringing some toys in the bathtub with you (rubber duckies are still fun even if you're 30!), watch some videos while you soak, grab a glass of wine, it's fine! Watch an episode of your favorite Youtube channel while you do the spongebath thing.  <newline>  <newline> 5. DO SOME GROOMING. Cut your fingernails, cut your toenails. File every nail until the sharp edges are gone. Do you like color? Find a fun nail polish color and reward yourself with some sparkle after that hard work of clipping and filing! Or grab a buffer and get your natural nails to look nice! Don't forget to use lotion for your hardworking hands and cuticles! Or grab some olive oil or almond oil, and give yourself a nice hand and foot massage! Brush your hair. Maybe trim your bangs, even, if you have those. Seeing is important.  <newline>  <newline> 6. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. It's spa time! Wash your face. Get a nice mask (homemade is fine) and put that on your skin, and relax for 15 minutes while watching something on Youtube or listening to a podcast or scrolling Reddit or whatever you wanna do. Then wash that mask off and enjoy your pretty skin! Put that face cream and eye cream on that's been sitting around all week, that you forgot about because you had other stuff to do and you were so tired or your routine got all sideways so you couldn't even.  <newline>  <newline> 7. TIDY UP YOUR HABITAT. Put on your headphones, crank up whatever music or podcast you love best, and let's do some tidying up! Make your bed, tidy your room, fold your clothes, hang them up, put them away. Set a timer for 2 minutes and organize a drawer in your dresser. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sort through that stack of mail or paperwork that's been sitting there all week. Set a timer for 2 minutes and toss some things on your desk you don't need any more. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe down as many surfaces in your room with a damp cloth or cleaning wipe as you can, before the timer goes off. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sweep the floor. Clean your toilet. Wipe down the sink. Set a timer for 5 minutes and go through some clutter in your bathroom. Toss old makeup. Toss old supplies of any kind that are expired and that you don't need any more. Toss ripped clothing items like underwear and socks that have seen better days. When the timer is up, the task is successful! Next, the kitchen. Put those dishes piling up in the sink, in the dishwasher, and run it. Or set a timer for 10 minutes and wash the dishes your own self if you are the dishwasher! Next, put a load of laundry in the washer. Did you forget about the laundry that was in the washer and smells funky now? Wash it again, with some vinegar in the bleach compartment. Vinegar is magical. Did you forget about that load in the dryer and things are wrinkly now? Most dryers have a refresh setting. Use it. Then take the clothes out immediately after the refresh cycle is done. <newline>  <newline> 8. RE-STOCK FOOD STUFFS. Hate grocery stores? Same! Use Instacart or your local grocery store website to either have the foodstuffs delivered, or put an order together and pick it up yourself. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your fridge and throw old/expired/yucky stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the fridge out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your pantry/cabinet/shelving and throw old/expired stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the pantry/cabinet/shelf down and organize things in there a little bit so you can actually see what's going on in there. <newline>  <newline> Remember -- these are simply suggestions to help get you going if you're not sure how to go about it. There are no hard-and-fast rules: you get to make those up for your own self. The important part is that you pay attention to yourself and take care of yourself: that's literally IT.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks, and let's encourage each other to care for ourselves. So we don't fall into the trap of ""it doesn't matter, nobody cares."" We care! You care! Let's care together, okay?";aspergirls;False;1;1.0;2022-07-02 12:00:11;/r/aspergirls/comments/vpq932/selfcare_saturday/;aspergirls

529;vkdjfk;Self-Care Saturday!;"  <newline> Happy weekend everybody! Let's spend some time to refocus ourselves on the self-care we probably neglected this week because of commitments like school, work, family, and so on. <newline>  <newline> Take some time out for yourself today and tomorrow! Remember that you matter, and be extra kind and mindful in taking care of your own mind and body and living environment. Take some time to tidy up your habitat! Surround yourself with a happy living space that's set up exactly how you like it. So you can relax instead of feeling guilty about not having the spoons to take care of it all week. <newline>  <newline> Timers are your friend! Your very very best friend! If a task seems super daunting, then set a short timer, and start doing the thing. When the time's up, you've accomplished a goal! We've added suggestions below, to help get you going: modify those to your own liking. You'll be amazed what you can get done in 2 minutes. Because you're awesome like that.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks and success stories with the rest of the community! We're proud of you for taking some time today to take care of yourself and your space!!! Every little bit counts, and every act of self-care helps! Spoons are hard to come by some days (or most days), so let's use them wisely. <newline>  <newline> Here are some to-do things you can accomplish today by investing yourself, into yourself, and reaping the benefits all throughout the week. <newline>  <newline> Today, please remember to: <newline>  <newline> 1. DRINK WATER. Pour yourself a big glass and sip on that over the next hour until it's all gone. <newline>  <newline> 2. BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Remember to not eat anything, and don't drink anything except water for 30 minutes afterwards. Replace your toothbrush this weekend (or add it to your shopping list) if yours is older and showing signs of being worn out. If you hate your toothbrush and it's not doing a good job, find one you like! Maybe even try an electric one or sonic one that makes brushing easier, but make sure the speed/intensity are adjustable to prevent a sensory nightmare. If you hate mint toothpaste, look for different flavors. It's fine. There are no rules, only clean teeth, as best as you can manage!  <newline>  <newline> 3. FLOSS YOUR TEETH. If you don't like floss string, that's ok. Use a plastic pre-strung flosser if that's easier. Or those tiny brushes to get in the spaces between your teeth. Buy a water flosser. It doesn't matter. Floss however best you can manage. If you're not sure how flossing works, do a Google search for a tutorial. It's fine to not know things. No shame in that game! It's never too late to learn a new skill! <newline>  <newline> 4. CLEAN YOUR WHOLE BODY. Take a shower. Take a bubble bath. If being wet and cold all over your body is a sensory nightmare, then grab a washcloth and bar of soap, and give yourself a thorough spongebath, one body section at a time. There are no rules: just get clean. You are absolutely encouraged to make this as fun for yourself as possible by playing music in the shower, bringing some toys in the bathtub with you (rubber duckies are still fun even if you're 30!), watch some videos while you soak, grab a glass of wine, it's fine! Watch an episode of your favorite Youtube channel while you do the spongebath thing.  <newline>  <newline> 5. DO SOME GROOMING. Cut your fingernails, cut your toenails. File every nail until the sharp edges are gone. Do you like color? Find a fun nail polish color and reward yourself with some sparkle after that hard work of clipping and filing! Or grab a buffer and get your natural nails to look nice! Don't forget to use lotion for your hardworking hands and cuticles! Or grab some olive oil or almond oil, and give yourself a nice hand and foot massage! Brush your hair. Maybe trim your bangs, even, if you have those. Seeing is important.  <newline>  <newline> 6. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. It's spa time! Wash your face. Get a nice mask (homemade is fine) and put that on your skin, and relax for 15 minutes while watching something on Youtube or listening to a podcast or scrolling Reddit or whatever you wanna do. Then wash that mask off and enjoy your pretty skin! Put that face cream and eye cream on that's been sitting around all week, that you forgot about because you had other stuff to do and you were so tired or your routine got all sideways so you couldn't even.  <newline>  <newline> 7. TIDY UP YOUR HABITAT. Put on your headphones, crank up whatever music or podcast you love best, and let's do some tidying up! Make your bed, tidy your room, fold your clothes, hang them up, put them away. Set a timer for 2 minutes and organize a drawer in your dresser. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sort through that stack of mail or paperwork that's been sitting there all week. Set a timer for 2 minutes and toss some things on your desk you don't need any more. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe down as many surfaces in your room with a damp cloth or cleaning wipe as you can, before the timer goes off. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sweep the floor. Clean your toilet. Wipe down the sink. Set a timer for 5 minutes and go through some clutter in your bathroom. Toss old makeup. Toss old supplies of any kind that are expired and that you don't need any more. Toss ripped clothing items like underwear and socks that have seen better days. When the timer is up, the task is successful! Next, the kitchen. Put those dishes piling up in the sink, in the dishwasher, and run it. Or set a timer for 10 minutes and wash the dishes your own self if you are the dishwasher! Next, put a load of laundry in the washer. Did you forget about the laundry that was in the washer and smells funky now? Wash it again, with some vinegar in the bleach compartment. Vinegar is magical. Did you forget about that load in the dryer and things are wrinkly now? Most dryers have a refresh setting. Use it. Then take the clothes out immediately after the refresh cycle is done. <newline>  <newline> 8. RE-STOCK FOOD STUFFS. Hate grocery stores? Same! Use Instacart or your local grocery store website to either have the foodstuffs delivered, or put an order together and pick it up yourself. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your fridge and throw old/expired/yucky stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the fridge out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your pantry/cabinet/shelving and throw old/expired stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the pantry/cabinet/shelf down and organize things in there a little bit so you can actually see what's going on in there. <newline>  <newline> Remember -- these are simply suggestions to help get you going if you're not sure how to go about it. There are no hard-and-fast rules: you get to make those up for your own self. The important part is that you pay attention to yourself and take care of yourself: that's literally IT.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks, and let's encourage each other to care for ourselves. So we don't fall into the trap of ""it doesn't matter, nobody cares."" We care! You care! Let's care together, okay?";aspergirls;False;2;0.92;2022-06-25 12:00:10;/r/aspergirls/comments/vkdjfk/selfcare_saturday/;aspergirls
530;vjftcg;I finally indulged a special interest of mine!!;I absolutely love tanks and everything to do with them, but I also adore aviation. My favorite aircraft is the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft. Conveniently, there are tons of models for tanks and aircraft, and I've spent years watching all manner of YouTube videos about modeling! I haven't built a model since I was 10 years old. I didn't have a wonderful home life, and all of my models were tossed into a box and broken. I haven't touched one sense.  <newline>  <newline> But, 14 years later, I finally worked up the courage to purchase 2 model kits! I've spent the last 3 days using them to decompress, relax, and feel productive! I was so nervous looking at them in the store, afraid that I would be horrible at it, or that I wasn't good enough to build one, but I did it anyway! And I'm having so much fun!! I've felt happier than I have in quite some time and even though it's not done yet I am really proud of it, and proud of myself!  <newline>  <newline> It's even helped during therapy! I can carefully glue the pieces together, carefully place the filling putty and trim the flashing off of parts while talking with my therapist. It makes therapy much more tolerable and more productive! My therapist has even noticed the difference.  <newline>  <newline> I am beyond elated and really proud that I've overcome a bit of my trauma and found a way to help cope with my ASD symptoms!;PupNessie;False;1;0.92;2022-06-24 04:26:34;/r/aspergirls/comments/vjftcg/i_finally_indulged_a_special_interest_of_mine/;aspergirls
531;vjak76;I was told that “high-functioning” is a problematic term and now I feel bad for using it;Last night during a FaceTime call, I was telling my boyfriend about “Love On The Spectrum.”  <newline>  <newline> After talking about all of the participants, I mentioned James (Renaissance guy with long blonde hair) and how my heart broke for him when his date asked if they could just be friends.  <newline>  <newline> Me, to my boyfriend: “I saw some of myself in James, though I’m not high-functioning.”  <newline>  <newline> My boyfriend: “Hey babe, just for future reference, you shouldn’t use the term ‘high-functioning.’ It’s problematic.” <newline>  <newline> Me: “Oh? Why?”  <newline>  <newline> Boyfriend: “High-functioning implies that there’s also ‘low-functioning.’ Granted everyone is different, but using a word like ‘mild’ should be fine.”  <newline>  <newline> Me: “Oh….. okay.”  <newline>  <newline> He proceeds to tell me that he’s heard that “high-functioning” is offensive to autistic people … and I’m confused as to whether he heard it from someone on Twitter or if he’s met several people in real-life who hold that viewpoint.  <newline>  <newline> Regardless, I feel bad.;smashintocake;False;97;0.91;2022-06-23 23:47:03;/r/aspergirls/comments/vjak76/i_was_told_that_highfunctioning_is_a_problematic/;aspergirls
532;vipyky;Extremely tired of verbal communication;Hello Reddit. I have checked all over the interwebs for advice regarding this issue, and all advice, even on other forums like WrongPlanet, dealt with different problems to the ones I am facing. I am just becoming extremely tired of having to communicate using my voice to other people. It's not even an issue of being tired of communication: as somebody who has consciously devoted her entire life to the pursuit of knowledge, I understand very well that communication is key to learning. My issue is with the act of speaking itself. My problems with the medium are numerous and varied: <newline>  <newline> 1. As a transgender woman, I experience intense, constant vocal dysphoria. <newline> 2. Verbal communication cannot be revised, unlike text communication. I think long about what I will say before I say it, but even then, it is too easy to mess up while speaking, which can lead to misunderstandings, which just add even more stress than usual. <newline> 3. I hate how there is no lasting record (besides fallible memory) of all ideas expressed in a conversation, unlike in text form. <newline> 4. For some reason, my vocal muscles seem weaker than normal, and after even a completely normal day, my throat aches. <newline> 5. Emotions are completely visible, supposedly, in verbal communication, but this does not apply to all. The way my brain works, I am horrible at picking up social cues, and, in my desire to understand every aspect of a conversation, will often misunderstand or over-analyze them, leading to confusion on my part. On the other hand, I am much better at picking up tone in writing, as well as conveying my own emotions, and for anything I cannot convey well through vocabulary, I can use tone indicators, emphasis, or emoticons. Even when emotions are fully conveyed in verbal communication, this can sometimes detract from the conversation and easily lead to argument. <newline> 6. My own speech can drown out the thoughts in my head. <newline> 7. Instant response is expected in verbal communication <newline> 8. Verbal communication is insecure. Anybody with a keen ear can pick out your conversation. <newline>  <newline> I am not selectively mute, I just have a general disdain for speech in general. This also does not come from a place of depression, unlike many of the aforementioned forum posts I read. Many wish to stop speaking because they do not feel heard when they do speak, but this is not my problem. I do not wish to isolate myself, I wish to more easily communicate. <newline>  <newline> In my version of an ideal world, casual communication would either be carried out through some form of telepathy, or an application, installed on every device, which would function as a proximity chat, similar to Airdrop in mechanism, but similar to Discord in application. Tone would be indicated in other ways than tone indicators or emoticons: one would use particular buttons for particular emotions or tones, and these would turn text a color corresponding to the tone. For the colorblind, these colors would become small symbols, like asterisks to show emphasis, around the text. I feel that nonverbal communication in this manner would be advantageous to verbal communication, even in accessibility, as text to speech technology is much farther advanced, and easy to use, than speech to text. <newline>  <newline> I apologize for that very lengthy introduction to my question, I just want to prevent any confusion about my motivations. <newline>  <newline> My questions are: <newline>  <newline> 1. Is it feasible at all to stop using verbal communication entirely in this digital age? <newline> 2. How might I go about departing from communicating verbally? <newline> 3. Any suggestions of alternative forms of communication, besides pen and paper, a basic digital notepad, and chat applications? (I would be hesitant to use ASL, as I would be consciously choosing to take a vow of silence indefinitely) <newline>  <newline> TL:DR: I hate verbal communication, and feel that it is inadequate for self-expression. I am searching for a way to replace it.;Ravenclaw41806;False;11;0.97;2022-06-23 06:06:51;/r/aspergirls/comments/vipyky/extremely_tired_of_verbal_communication/;aspergirls

534;vf8yse;No one likes my social media posts;I know a lot of people will say it “doesn’t matter” but it makes me feel absolutely worthless and hated.  <newline>  <newline> Even people I thought were friends who I’ve hung out with regularly, never liked my posts even when we were hanging out a lot. Its almost like they’re embarrassed to know me.  <newline>  <newline> The worst part is that I used to be pretty popular on social media in high school until I had a mental breakdown and got really depressed (and ended up coming out as a trans guy, but then a couple years later realized I wasn’t). <newline>  <newline> Its just weird that I used to get so much validation and now it feels like everyone hates me. It makes me feel like I’m the “bottom of the barrel” or just so unlikable. If I post on facebook I’ll usually get 0-2 likes and it hurts because i try to interact or like other peoples posts.;bloodm000n;False;15;0.85;2022-06-18 15:48:30;/r/aspergirls/comments/vf8yse/no_one_likes_my_social_media_posts/;aspergirls

540;v9z2hr;Hoping I've found my tribe - new to exploring possible ASD;"I feel oddly nervous about writing this.  I know nobody can provide a diagnosis or anything, but I just wanted to reach out because I suspect I might have ASD and I feel in need of validation (hope that doesn't sound weird - it's the best way I can put it).  I'm grateful that this community exists regardless, because I've spent the last 2 weeks reading and researching everything I can and have read so many experiences I can relate to on here. <newline>  <newline> I'm 42 years old, female, and throughout my life I've always been different and weird, without really knowing why.  I've wondered before about autism, but always discounted it because I felt surely somebody would have said something by now??  And I guess because the portrayal of it is so stereotypical, I thought that since I can communicate, I'm empathic and I get emotional, and I'm not into trains etc that I don't fit the criteria.  Except I saw an article a few weeks ago that talked about a 42 year old woman who had just been diagnosed, and it sparked further questions.  And then I met with my friend who mentioned it's been suggested to her that she has some autistic traits, so we swapped stories and I have all the same ones (we are very alike - I suspect it's why we've remained friends all these years, as we grew up together). <newline>  <newline> It turns out I've been stimming my whole life and never realised.  I remember going through a phase at school of rubbing my hands together intensely whenever I was stressed, until I got bullied for it.  But I have a habit of rubbing my fingers in some way (usually I will rub across the nail, cuticle or the sides of the nail, or else sort of twirl my fingers), or fiddling with my lips - it's this thing where I'm either biting my lips, or else rubbing my fingernails, cuticles or rough skin against them. <newline>  <newline> I also used to never know what to do with my hands/arms, and it never felt right to me to just have them dangling or swinging by my sides, so I had to either have them in a pocket or be carrying something.  It used to freak me out, and I used to ask people what to do with my arms. <newline>  <newline> I'm well known for being extremely blunt - my mum used to call me tactless, because I've always just spoken my mind, and couldn't understand why it would upset anyone.  At work colleagues will often laugh at something I've said, when I didn't mean it to come across so bluntly, and I feel like they often look to me to say the thing they're all thinking but won't say out loud. <newline>  <newline> I was always top of my class at school and got bullied for that too.  And when I was little, I was told it was exhausting looking after me - apparently I never slept properly until I was nearly 5, my parents gave me homework from the age of 3 just to try and tire me out, and I threw my everything into whatever I did (my paintings at nursery/school usually took a week to dry, so I could never bring my stuff home same day like the other kids). <newline>  <newline> I get really intense emotional reactions to minor things, and I see from the way my husband looks at me and how he talks to me (he often will prompt me to breathe and tell me to let something go) that how I'm reacting isn't ""normal"".  I also find that when I do get these intense emotions, especially if I have an ""upset"" reaction, I often struggle to identify exactly what I'm feeling and why I've reacted that way - it can take me a long time to figure it out, so when my husband asks what's wrong I mostly say I don't know because I don't.  I've been told I'm extremely empathic, to the point my last 2 line managers have commented on it, but it's exhausting because I deal with people for a living (I'm in the emergency services) so when I come home I just want to crash or be alone.  My husband describes me as being extremely independent, and all the activities I enjoy doing are things I do by myself.  I'm not terribly social, I literally have 1 friend right now and struggle finding/keeping friends for some reason - I see my colleagues socialising with one another and I get upset that I'm not included, but at the same time I don't really want to.  I get on with them fine, but I always wonder why I'm never invited or if I am, it's only if the entire team is meeting up and actually somehow something always happens so I never end up going. <newline>  <newline> I've spoken to my mum briefly about me being autistic, and she's not dismissed it but pointed out that one habit I have is ""researching something to the nth degree"" (her words) and that when I get an interest or focus on something, I go well beyond what my peers or others do and have to know absolutely everything about that thing.  And now that I'm focused on ASD, of course I'm obsessing about it - reading everything that I can, taking every quiz going over and over, listening to talks on youtube, researching everything possible about it. <newline>  <newline> I'm sorry this is so long, it's another characteristic of mine - the struggle of always seeming to write a novel! <newline>  <newline> Anyway, thank you for reading, and I just wondered - for those that self-diagnosed, how long before you felt comfortable with that diagnosis?  I feel like although I relate to a lot of symptoms and experiences, I still see things I do that are considered more NT (is that the word?) and so it makes me wonder about everything.  But reading about autism has somehow helped explain my life in a way that finally makes sense.  Maybe I'm not just some weird loner, and maybe there's nothing wrong with me after all.";Curlysar;False;9;0.95;2022-06-11 14:47:19;/r/aspergirls/comments/v9z2hr/hoping_ive_found_my_tribe_new_to_exploring/;aspergirls
541;v9w39c;Self-Care Saturday!;"  <newline> Happy weekend everybody! Let's spend some time to refocus ourselves on the self-care we probably neglected this week because of commitments like school, work, family, and so on. <newline>  <newline> Take some time out for yourself today and tomorrow! Remember that you matter, and be extra kind and mindful in taking care of your own mind and body and living environment. Take some time to tidy up your habitat! Surround yourself with a happy living space that's set up exactly how you like it. So you can relax instead of feeling guilty about not having the spoons to take care of it all week. <newline>  <newline> Timers are your friend! Your very very best friend! If a task seems super daunting, then set a short timer, and start doing the thing. When the time's up, you've accomplished a goal! We've added suggestions below, to help get you going: modify those to your own liking. You'll be amazed what you can get done in 2 minutes. Because you're awesome like that.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks and success stories with the rest of the community! We're proud of you for taking some time today to take care of yourself and your space!!! Every little bit counts, and every act of self-care helps! Spoons are hard to come by some days (or most days), so let's use them wisely. <newline>  <newline> Here are some to-do things you can accomplish today by investing yourself, into yourself, and reaping the benefits all throughout the week. <newline>  <newline> Today, please remember to: <newline>  <newline> 1. DRINK WATER. Pour yourself a big glass and sip on that over the next hour until it's all gone. <newline>  <newline> 2. BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Remember to not eat anything, and don't drink anything except water for 30 minutes afterwards. Replace your toothbrush this weekend (or add it to your shopping list) if yours is older and showing signs of being worn out. If you hate your toothbrush and it's not doing a good job, find one you like! Maybe even try an electric one or sonic one that makes brushing easier, but make sure the speed/intensity are adjustable to prevent a sensory nightmare. If you hate mint toothpaste, look for different flavors. It's fine. There are no rules, only clean teeth, as best as you can manage!  <newline>  <newline> 3. FLOSS YOUR TEETH. If you don't like floss string, that's ok. Use a plastic pre-strung flosser if that's easier. Or those tiny brushes to get in the spaces between your teeth. Buy a water flosser. It doesn't matter. Floss however best you can manage. If you're not sure how flossing works, do a Google search for a tutorial. It's fine to not know things. No shame in that game! It's never too late to learn a new skill! <newline>  <newline> 4. CLEAN YOUR WHOLE BODY. Take a shower. Take a bubble bath. If being wet and cold all over your body is a sensory nightmare, then grab a washcloth and bar of soap, and give yourself a thorough spongebath, one body section at a time. There are no rules: just get clean. You are absolutely encouraged to make this as fun for yourself as possible by playing music in the shower, bringing some toys in the bathtub with you (rubber duckies are still fun even if you're 30!), watch some videos while you soak, grab a glass of wine, it's fine! Watch an episode of your favorite Youtube channel while you do the spongebath thing.  <newline>  <newline> 5. DO SOME GROOMING. Cut your fingernails, cut your toenails. File every nail until the sharp edges are gone. Do you like color? Find a fun nail polish color and reward yourself with some sparkle after that hard work of clipping and filing! Or grab a buffer and get your natural nails to look nice! Don't forget to use lotion for your hardworking hands and cuticles! Or grab some olive oil or almond oil, and give yourself a nice hand and foot massage! Brush your hair. Maybe trim your bangs, even, if you have those. Seeing is important.  <newline>  <newline> 6. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. It's spa time! Wash your face. Get a nice mask (homemade is fine) and put that on your skin, and relax for 15 minutes while watching something on Youtube or listening to a podcast or scrolling Reddit or whatever you wanna do. Then wash that mask off and enjoy your pretty skin! Put that face cream and eye cream on that's been sitting around all week, that you forgot about because you had other stuff to do and you were so tired or your routine got all sideways so you couldn't even.  <newline>  <newline> 7. TIDY UP YOUR HABITAT. Put on your headphones, crank up whatever music or podcast you love best, and let's do some tidying up! Make your bed, tidy your room, fold your clothes, hang them up, put them away. Set a timer for 2 minutes and organize a drawer in your dresser. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sort through that stack of mail or paperwork that's been sitting there all week. Set a timer for 2 minutes and toss some things on your desk you don't need any more. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe down as many surfaces in your room with a damp cloth or cleaning wipe as you can, before the timer goes off. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sweep the floor. Clean your toilet. Wipe down the sink. Set a timer for 5 minutes and go through some clutter in your bathroom. Toss old makeup. Toss old supplies of any kind that are expired and that you don't need any more. Toss ripped clothing items like underwear and socks that have seen better days. When the timer is up, the task is successful! Next, the kitchen. Put those dishes piling up in the sink, in the dishwasher, and run it. Or set a timer for 10 minutes and wash the dishes your own self if you are the dishwasher! Next, put a load of laundry in the washer. Did you forget about the laundry that was in the washer and smells funky now? Wash it again, with some vinegar in the bleach compartment. Vinegar is magical. Did you forget about that load in the dryer and things are wrinkly now? Most dryers have a refresh setting. Use it. Then take the clothes out immediately after the refresh cycle is done. <newline>  <newline> 8. RE-STOCK FOOD STUFFS. Hate grocery stores? Same! Use Instacart or your local grocery store website to either have the foodstuffs delivered, or put an order together and pick it up yourself. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your fridge and throw old/expired/yucky stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the fridge out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your pantry/cabinet/shelving and throw old/expired stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the pantry/cabinet/shelf down and organize things in there a little bit so you can actually see what's going on in there. <newline>  <newline> Remember -- these are simply suggestions to help get you going if you're not sure how to go about it. There are no hard-and-fast rules: you get to make those up for your own self. The important part is that you pay attention to yourself and take care of yourself: that's literally IT.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks, and let's encourage each other to care for ourselves. So we don't fall into the trap of ""it doesn't matter, nobody cares."" We care! You care! Let's care together, okay?";aspergirls;False;0;1.0;2022-06-11 12:00:11;/r/aspergirls/comments/v9w39c/selfcare_saturday/;aspergirls
542;v7vwej;Help! How do you show someone you like them?;"I'm slowly falling for a guy and I'm not sure whether I'm trying too hard or not! We're working together and he's super intelligent and very attractive imo! He's pretty much my type on all levels so far! <newline> I have noooo idea if he's flirting with me and I have no idea if I'm flirting back, even though I'm trying to laugh at his joke, keep eye contact with him and sometimes touch my hair in front of him. I'm trying to talk to him everyday, show interest in his hobbies, ask him about his life etc. <newline> I recently found out that we both have lost a parent when we were the same young age! So we're bonding over that and I also told him that he could always talk to me! <newline>  <newline> At lunch I make sure to sit beside him or right in front of him, always, and he is actually doing the same to me, if I sit down first. <newline> He doesn't seem to mind getting close to me at all. He seems comfortable around me, so when he's helping me at my desk, our legs sometimes touch and he doesn't move away or seem uncomfortable, while I'm just swooning on the inside! We have also touched each other's hands this way, very innocent-ish!  <newline>  <newline> I'm frequently trying to get him to join social stuff after work among other colleagues, to get to spend more time with him, but he's not 100% up for it, because he has his dog to take care of. I had almost convinced him to come to the social stuff on Friday, but he has now decided to work from home that day. I'm kinda bummed out about it, but I understand him not wanting to leave his dog alone for too long. <newline>  <newline> I have befriended him on Messenger and I'm messaging him outside of work also. I'm not doing it every day, to make sure that I don't seem too desperate. One evening he wrote to me just as I thought of writing to him and I literally squealed! He asked for my opinion on something and he followed through with my feedback! I was like ""Whoa that's a great sign! He values my opinion!"". <newline> I helped out a colleague the today and I was laughing at something she said, then noticed he was looking at me, I looked back at him while I kept laughing and then I looked back at her to continue the convo I had with her. I don't know if I was blushing but I did feel happy inside, that he was looking at me, like maybe he admired me and didn't think I would notice? No clue! But it felt nice regardless! <newline>  <newline> Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can make it clear to him that I'm interested, without coming off as an idiot? :')";camillabambi14;False;4;0.88;2022-06-08 18:05:39;/r/aspergirls/comments/v7vwej/help_how_do_you_show_someone_you_like_them/;aspergirls

544;v1vtzs;Is it an autistic thing to not feel the pressure to be a part of social media?;I get how a lot of people like to share their lives in this way. and it's fine if they enjoy it. but to me, all the websites like Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Twitter, etc....since you are not anonymous on those websites, it feels like an invasion of privacy. that's why I prefer Reddit. I am glad I didn't grow up around social media. things like Facebook, Instagram, etc...were not even out when I was younger. I didn't even have a cell phone when I was younger. I didn't see anything wrong with it. even though I am aware that it's common to want to be a part of social media, I just don't understand all the hype about it. I feel more comfortable not being a part of it. I feel like I am a more grounded person because when I was a kid and a teenager, social media wasn't a huge thing yet. and I feel like I didn't miss out. If I wanted to listen to a song, we had to listen to it on the radio or see the music video on tv, not a computer screen or Youtube. I honestly miss that part of growing up. it felt more authentic. I understand things change, but new doesn't always mean better. I still listen to old music because that's what I grew up with. I can't become interested in a new song only because it's new and trendy. I feel like being autistic causes me to not feel the need to join things like Facebook, Instagram, and I don't feel bad about it.

547;uyamxx;I'm so tired of Abbey on Tiktok;"I generally keep scrolling so the algorithm doesn't recommend me her too often, but the whole thing just makes me feel so upset and uncomfortable :( They just film her walking around and having demeaning conversations with whoever's filming. Like, please, continue to pimp out your disabled daughter for money and views online and on Love on the Spectrum - that's sooo cool and progressive of you.  <newline>  <newline> The comments are even worse. The way people fall over themselves is awful, talking about her like she's a cute little dog or something, like she's not a human being. The fact that they're not even doing it to be mean is almost more painful. It reminds me of when a popular girl takes the disabled kid to a dance for clout, putting up captions like ""my best friend"" and ""the sweetest gentlemen"" on Instagram while never actually viewing him as a real human person or a real friend because he's not their intellectual equal. That's the exact same way that they treat Abbey.";chesapeake_ripperz;False;7;0.91;2022-05-26 15:49:40;/r/aspergirls/comments/uyamxx/im_so_tired_of_abbey_on_tiktok/;aspergirls
548;uy7foz;Things I experience I didn't realize were ASD until later - Part 2!;"Hey, I figured I'd follow up on my old post to add some more things I realized were ASD once I started educating myself! It seemed to be helpful and relatable to lots of people so I'd figure I'd service my favorite community once more and add some *more* of my autistic traits! <newline>  <newline> * My boyfriend pointed out that I hold my arms to my chest often like a T-rex. Imagine my shock when I looked up ""T-rex arms"" and found out it was an autistic thing! <newline> * I've always been made fun of for the way I run, and this is because I run on my toes. I never fully related with the ""toe walking"" except in certain instances when the floor feels weird to touch. When I walk, I tend to drag my feet which I think results in me breaking socks and getting heel blisters with new shoes. <newline> * I realized I *do* struggle with eye contact! Looking directly into people's eyes gives me physical anxiety symptoms, so I just look at faces. My eye contact gets even more wonky when I'm the one talking, for some reason. <newline> * I can't keep up friendships for the life of me. As I've gotten older, I've learned how to *start* them, but not continue them. <newline> * I have been doing some observations of the people around me and it turns out that my childhood best friend, my longtime online best friend, my mom, and my mom's dad were all autistic. My life is a lie. <newline> * I learned from a TikTok that a neurodivergent love language is parallel play, where you both engage in your own separate activities side by side. I've done this with my friends and even my boyfriend (who is allistic) my entire life! <newline> * I was flagged multiple times in elementary school by teachers to be taken out of class for ""social skills"" seminars(?). I also had to join a social skills club, which I was embarrassed about because I knew it was for the ""weird kids"" and I didn't see how I fit with them. <newline> * I never thought bright lights and loud noises were a sensory issue for me until I realized how irritable and quiet I got around them. <newline> * Speaking of being quiet, I didn't think I ever went non verbal but I notice that when I'm extremely stressed and forced to talk to someone, I talk like a toddler. I've been told to ""grow up"" and ""talk like an adult"" in these situations. <newline> * On the flip side, I actually was hyperverbal as a kid (and still am today: I love big words). Teachers often praised me and my parents for how fluently I could talk and use an expansive vocabulary. <newline> * Medications seem to work differently for me than NTs. For instance, SSRIs sap all my energy away, almost like it ""gives"" me depression. I was put on Ritalin for my comorbid ADHD and it makes me talkative and I still don't feel like I can do my schoolwork. I'm actually swapping out stimulants today potentially. <newline> * Almost forgot a big one I wanted to add! Ever since I was in third grade, I had trichotillomania (hair pulling). I mainly pulled out my eyelashes, but also my eyebrows and eventually split ends. I found out later that this is a stim (a maladaptive one I'm still trying to replace) and it made me feel less crazy. Oddly enough, this is the first reason my parents wanted to bring me to therapy. <newline>  <newline> Hope this can help you guys! Let me know if you relate, have questions, or have any other points to share!";dogsayscow;False;10;0.95;2022-05-26 13:17:37;/r/aspergirls/comments/uy7foz/things_i_experience_i_didnt_realize_were_asd/;aspergirls
549;uxuyi9;I Think I’m Autistic?;Hi everyone. So I (20F)started dating my boyfriend (20) at the end of 2020 during my freshman year of college. He has ADHD and he didn’t really know a lot about it. So I researched and then it started popping up on my Instagram feed. And the way actual people with ADHD described it, it made so much sense to me.  <newline>  <newline> I really identified with some of the symptoms and stories. And my boyfriend and mom agreed after I told them about my research. I made an appointment for an evaluation which was a 2 month wait. During that time, I looked up some of my “quirks” I guess…I would look it up to see if it related to ADHD. Then…autism groups and pages started to pop up. And when I tell you guys. I found this page and I felt like everything really clicked.  <newline> The scripting of conversations. The disinterest in conversations of people my age. I even looked up some of my quirks when it comes to sex..AND YOU GUYS RELATED.  <newline>  <newline> I struggled so much when I was younger because I grew up in Black Caribbean households(moved a lot with aunts,uncles, and grandparents). If I was uncomfortable with things (foods, textures, clothing, noises) I had to suck it up or I was “ungrateful”. I would get confused in conversations and people would get upset…so I would mirror them …and I was somehow rude in the end? I got in trouble at school sometimes in elementary school because I over compensated when trying to make friends.  <newline>  <newline> I took things too literally so I missed jokes. Or I would think about things way too deeply. I begged my grandma to take me to the United States because everywhere else I went, I saw “Welcome to blank” but I never saw “Welcome to the United States of America.” It bothered me that no one else was upset by silent letters. If they are silent…WHY ARE THEY IN THE WOZRD-the x is silent. And why didn’t we pronounce words exactly the way the letters sounded? Or when they would ask me “do you have sense” but I thought of cents and said “no but I have dollars.” Things like that. <newline>  <newline> I couldn’t stop researching autism. I still can’t actually. Anyways, I took tests like the RAADS-R and I keep scoring within the same range. I found that Samantha Craft list which was very enlightening. Black women who were diagnosed in their 20s had similar experience as me. I told my mom and she said “yeah, I was thinking you were autistic back when you were in the 7th grade.” <newline>  <newline> I recently went in for my ADHD results and she said I have a panic disorder, remnants of PTSD, and GAD. I new about the panic disorder and GAD. But I was listening to some of the things she thought I felt and I told her that it wasn’t the case. She said my lack of eye contact is due to fear. The reason I can’t maintain friendships is due to fear and that I don’t like going out is because I’m avoidant. I told that I was cheer captain so she told me that clearly I’m able to put on a mask. And that I am clearly capable, I just need to go out more.  I did not want an ADHD diagnosis but to be treated like I wasn’t the owner of my brain was a strange experience. <newline>  <newline> I told her during my ADHD evaluation that I didn’t want meds. But she said that I need to take anxiety meds and that it’s good that I have something that can be treated. I told her I didn’t want them but she insisted on calling my doctor and telling her that I might call in for them. <newline>  <newline> As I was leaving she recommended therapy. I was hesitant after the way she just invalidated me, but she insisted. I told her that I needed a Black therapist(previous bad experiences) and she laughed and said “I used to have Black roommates so I 1000% get it” okay I guess. There is a Black therapist but I don’t even know if I’m going to mention to her that I think I might be autistic because I felt as if I being spoken at instead of to. <newline>  <newline> I decided to make a post because my boyfriend and mom are tired of listening. But I keep thinking about 3rd grade me who would get home from school and stand in the bathroom mirror and repeatedly ask “who am I”?.I would stim in the bathroom and I would always think the kids I went to school with were doing the same. So how do I stop talking about feeling like my life finally makes sense. <newline>  <newline> It’s strange that people are actually going to see this.;NoDistribution8970;False;3;0.89;2022-05-26 00:14:14;/r/aspergirls/comments/uxuyi9/i_think_im_autistic/;aspergirls
550;uxpp18;Habit I do that I never thought was a sensory issue.;"Seen a random post on Instagram, saying ""Autistic Life: Not being able to sleep until every single strand of your hair is tucked up so it isn't touching your neck"".  <newline>  <newline> And I was like, wow. I have been doing this thing since I was a kid and it actually may be related to autism? <newline>  <newline> So, before I can go to bed, while lying on my pillow, I take my hair and push it up over my head and off my neck. I mean, thinking about it, it makes sense why it's a sensory issue for me. I just can't stand the itchiness/sctratchiness of hair pressed against my neck or sound of hair when it rubes together as I move.  <newline>  <newline> Until recently, I had long hair, but I would always have my hair up in someway to get it off my neck when I went to bed. Now that I chopped it off due to the upcoming summer season, it's too short to put in an updo or braids, I started to push my hair up over my head and off my neck again. <newline>  <newline> Anyone else can't have your hair touching your neck when you are trying to sleep?";Happy_Original2153;False;45;0.99;2022-05-25 19:59:32;/r/aspergirls/comments/uxpp18/habit_i_do_that_i_never_thought_was_a_sensory/;aspergirls
551;uuwcmw;Why do my friends keep ignoring me?;I don’t think they’re doing it to be mean? It still hurts though. In our discord chat, I listen when they want to talk about their favorite things. I ask questions so that they’ll talk about them more. They love talking about their things. I love listening to them talk about their favorite things! <newline>  <newline> But whenever I post about something I love and want to talk about, everyone ignores my message. They will just go talk in a different channel and don’t even acknowledge that I’ve said anything. This has happened pretty much every single time. With how many times it’s happened, I don’t think it’s a coincidence at this point. <newline>  <newline> I don’t get it. I don’t think I’m being annoying. I barely say anything about my stuff, so why the few times that I do, no one ever cares? Why do they so blatantly ignore me and then go talk somewhere else where I can see them starting/having a completely different conversation? <newline>  <newline> I want to just straight-up ask them if they don’t want me to be there. If they don’t want me there, I’ll leave. It’s fine and I’d understand if they don’t feel I mesh well with the group. I just wish I could get a read on them. And I can’t just go accusing them of not liking me because I do think they genuinely like me as a person. I just don’t understand why they respond the way they do and it’s driving me crazy.;Weekly_Commercial484;False;5;0.83;2022-05-21 21:23:00;/r/aspergirls/comments/uuwcmw/why_do_my_friends_keep_ignoring_me/;aspergirls
552;uulmzd;Self-Care Saturday!;"  <newline> Happy weekend everybody! Let's spend some time to refocus ourselves on the self-care we probably neglected this week because of commitments like school, work, family, and so on. <newline>  <newline> Take some time out for yourself today and tomorrow! Remember that you matter, and be extra kind and mindful in taking care of your own mind and body and living environment. Take some time to tidy up your habitat! Surround yourself with a happy living space that's set up exactly how you like it. So you can relax instead of feeling guilty about not having the spoons to take care of it all week. <newline>  <newline> Timers are your friend! Your very very best friend! If a task seems super daunting, then set a short timer, and start doing the thing. When the time's up, you've accomplished a goal! We've added suggestions below, to help get you going: modify those to your own liking. You'll be amazed what you can get done in 2 minutes. Because you're awesome like that.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks and success stories with the rest of the community! We're proud of you for taking some time today to take care of yourself and your space!!! Every little bit counts, and every act of self-care helps! Spoons are hard to come by some days (or most days), so let's use them wisely. <newline>  <newline> Here are some to-do things you can accomplish today by investing yourself, into yourself, and reaping the benefits all throughout the week. <newline>  <newline> Today, please remember to: <newline>  <newline> 1. DRINK WATER. Pour yourself a big glass and sip on that over the next hour until it's all gone. <newline>  <newline> 2. BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Remember to not eat anything, and don't drink anything except water for 30 minutes afterwards. Replace your toothbrush this weekend (or add it to your shopping list) if yours is older and showing signs of being worn out. If you hate your toothbrush and it's not doing a good job, find one you like! Maybe even try an electric one or sonic one that makes brushing easier, but make sure the speed/intensity are adjustable to prevent a sensory nightmare. If you hate mint toothpaste, look for different flavors. It's fine. There are no rules, only clean teeth, as best as you can manage!  <newline>  <newline> 3. FLOSS YOUR TEETH. If you don't like floss string, that's ok. Use a plastic pre-strung flosser if that's easier. Or those tiny brushes to get in the spaces between your teeth. Buy a water flosser. It doesn't matter. Floss however best you can manage. If you're not sure how flossing works, do a Google search for a tutorial. It's fine to not know things. No shame in that game! It's never too late to learn a new skill! <newline>  <newline> 4. CLEAN YOUR WHOLE BODY. Take a shower. Take a bubble bath. If being wet and cold all over your body is a sensory nightmare, then grab a washcloth and bar of soap, and give yourself a thorough spongebath, one body section at a time. There are no rules: just get clean. You are absolutely encouraged to make this as fun for yourself as possible by playing music in the shower, bringing some toys in the bathtub with you (rubber duckies are still fun even if you're 30!), watch some videos while you soak, grab a glass of wine, it's fine! Watch an episode of your favorite Youtube channel while you do the spongebath thing.  <newline>  <newline> 5. DO SOME GROOMING. Cut your fingernails, cut your toenails. File every nail until the sharp edges are gone. Do you like color? Find a fun nail polish color and reward yourself with some sparkle after that hard work of clipping and filing! Or grab a buffer and get your natural nails to look nice! Don't forget to use lotion for your hardworking hands and cuticles! Or grab some olive oil or almond oil, and give yourself a nice hand and foot massage! Brush your hair. Maybe trim your bangs, even, if you have those. Seeing is important.  <newline>  <newline> 6. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. It's spa time! Wash your face. Get a nice mask (homemade is fine) and put that on your skin, and relax for 15 minutes while watching something on Youtube or listening to a podcast or scrolling Reddit or whatever you wanna do. Then wash that mask off and enjoy your pretty skin! Put that face cream and eye cream on that's been sitting around all week, that you forgot about because you had other stuff to do and you were so tired or your routine got all sideways so you couldn't even.  <newline>  <newline> 7. TIDY UP YOUR HABITAT. Put on your headphones, crank up whatever music or podcast you love best, and let's do some tidying up! Make your bed, tidy your room, fold your clothes, hang them up, put them away. Set a timer for 2 minutes and organize a drawer in your dresser. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sort through that stack of mail or paperwork that's been sitting there all week. Set a timer for 2 minutes and toss some things on your desk you don't need any more. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe down as many surfaces in your room with a damp cloth or cleaning wipe as you can, before the timer goes off. Set a timer for 2 minutes and sweep the floor. Clean your toilet. Wipe down the sink. Set a timer for 5 minutes and go through some clutter in your bathroom. Toss old makeup. Toss old supplies of any kind that are expired and that you don't need any more. Toss ripped clothing items like underwear and socks that have seen better days. When the timer is up, the task is successful! Next, the kitchen. Put those dishes piling up in the sink, in the dishwasher, and run it. Or set a timer for 10 minutes and wash the dishes your own self if you are the dishwasher! Next, put a load of laundry in the washer. Did you forget about the laundry that was in the washer and smells funky now? Wash it again, with some vinegar in the bleach compartment. Vinegar is magical. Did you forget about that load in the dryer and things are wrinkly now? Most dryers have a refresh setting. Use it. Then take the clothes out immediately after the refresh cycle is done. <newline>  <newline> 8. RE-STOCK FOOD STUFFS. Hate grocery stores? Same! Use Instacart or your local grocery store website to either have the foodstuffs delivered, or put an order together and pick it up yourself. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your fridge and throw old/expired/yucky stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the fridge out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and go through your pantry/cabinet/shelving and throw old/expired stuff out. Set a timer for 2 minutes and wipe the pantry/cabinet/shelf down and organize things in there a little bit so you can actually see what's going on in there. <newline>  <newline> Remember -- these are simply suggestions to help get you going if you're not sure how to go about it. There are no hard-and-fast rules: you get to make those up for your own self. The important part is that you pay attention to yourself and take care of yourself: that's literally IT.  <newline>  <newline> Please share your own tips and tricks, and let's encourage each other to care for ourselves. So we don't fall into the trap of ""it doesn't matter, nobody cares."" We care! You care!

557;11lof9y;Part 2 of my experiences with failed NT female relationships;"Here's [part one ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticLadies/comments/11kt1xr/27f_dae_struggle_and_wounded_from_nt_past_female/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for a broader context  <newline>  <newline> There have been a couple of vivid incidents where my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness have caused problems in my friendships.  <newline>  <newline> For example, I turned down an invitation to a weekday ladies' night from a friend (lets call her Penny) who was possibly landing a full job at a media agency she interned at for a few months. I struggled to celebrate her accomplishments without feeling waves of resentment and discouragement, which made me feel guilty. I gave Penny some context to why I had my reservations (don't remember what I said exactly, along the lines of experiencing a lot of family issues which held be back in life). She thanked me for opening up and also explained that it was ""easier"" for the company to keep her and ease her into the role than hire someone more qualified but on LOWER pay. We didn't know each other for long at that point although she told me in her exact words that she liked me enough as a friend to want me to be part of her achievement. A part of me felt guilty for being quick to make a snap judgment based on what was expressed externally. <newline>  <newline> Another example was when an ex-friend, *Serena changed her Facebook profile picture of her law degree graduation photo. I couldn't bring myself to congratulate her because of my own struggles with internships, post-college preparation, blurred boundaries with family, and being in a new country. Our friendship started when I got involved with a guy from our rival school whom I met on Tumblr.  It was a very gradual build-up of him unvieling his true colors although I'll spare the details of that for now. I experienced conflicting emotions in my friendship with *Serena as once we pursued our respective degrees, we formed our own groups of friends and found that the people in our new circles shared more similarities with each of us individually than we ever did as a pair. While she taught me the value of genuine friendship, she started avoiding me as our goals and personalities diverged. I also know at the back of her mind that part of it was her not feeling supported as much as she was supportive of me. <newline>  <newline> As I get older, it becomes harder to justify my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness, which can come across as uncaring and insensitive. I know that society expects women to possess maturity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and social awareness, but as someone with a different neurotype, I struggle to meet these expectations. Sometimes, I really don't know how to handle it, or I am fighting my own demons behind closed doors, or it's a combination of the two.";East_Midnight2812;False;5;0.76;2023-03-08 06:17:46;/r/AutisticLadies/comments/11lof9y/part_2_of_my_experiences_with_failed_nt_female/;autisticladies

561;10g9zy1;What was your evaluation process?;So I'm in the process of getting an evaluation in Puerto Rico (US Territory) and I'm a cis woman.

Therapist said that he's an excellent choice.

I checked their practice website (facebook lol) and he is a pediatric neuropsychologist that specializes in autism and neurodevelopmental disorders but he diagnoses adults. It doesn't say which tests he does for the eval but they did put posts about how ASD presents differently in women and how 80% of women don't get diagnosed by the time they're 18 and that everyone with ASD is different.  <newline>  <newline> Therapist recommended me Dr. B. I could get an appointment with Dr. B as soon as February/March but here's the thing: When I called, they told me that it was 50 mins to 1 hour and 15 mins process and that you'll know the results at the end of the appointment. I asked if they needed a family member or friend for the process and they said that since I'm an adult, they won't need it.  I went to their facebook and it says that they specialize in diagnosing autism and that they do 4 tests (ados-2, adir, cars, and gars). On a post about a telehealth evaluation process she stated that it's very important for her to see the hands. Mine would be in person but that vid gave me the impression that she would specifically look for stereotypical hand stims.  <newline>  <newline> Therapist said that they're both excellent people and she has not seen an evaluation from them that she did not agree with. She knows the appointment with Dr  A but she recommended me Dr. B to see if it can be done earlier and it would be closer to where I live. I told my worry with my friend that works in ABA (she focuses on teaching life skills and does not support stim suppression) about how fast Dr. B's evaluation is and she says that evaluations are normally that short.  <newline>  <newline> From your evaluation experience, are they normally that short? And if anyone knows the tests Dr. B does, would they be effective for someone that barely remembers their childhood due to trauma and has low self awareness? From what I recall I never felt different enough or an alien and don't recall being called weird or rude. I did get the autistic experience of not knowing that you were bullied until later. I didn't feel bullied because I always talked back to them and gave them attitude. I thought the bullying was more of them being jealous of my good grades and just being assholes by nitpicking what I did. I don't even know if I'm actively masking anything lol I only started questioning because of tiktok and my ABA friend told me that I'm definitely autistic when I questioned her.  <newline>  <newline> Evaluations are way cheaper here compared to the states so I can afford either of them. I'm just not sure if Dr. B is worth spending $375. Dr. A  is more expensive (can't remember the amount) but it's definitely less than $800  and I can pay in installments in order to get the results. Which one would you get based on the info? <newline>  <newline>  Thanks in advance for any input.;simonsaysonsteroids;False;7;0.83;2023-01-19 18:59:42;/r/AutisticLadies/comments/10g9zy1/what_was_your_evaluation_process/;autisticladies
562;zfk9cy;Student-led mobile app startup; Hi everyone! <newline>  <newline> We are a team of 4 college students who are creating a rating and review mobile app for those with disabilities and sensory triggers. The platform will display the mobility, accessibility, noise levels, and lighting of local businesses. Along with these features, you will also be able to leave reviews for your neighbors to read. For parents or caregivers of those with disabilities or sensory triggers, it can be extremely difficult to plan where to eat, shop, or go when there are unfamiliar environments. Whether you are a local wanting to explore your city more, or visiting for the first time, we hope you will join us on our mission towards a more sensory friendly and accessible world.  <newline>  <newline> We are launching in Charleston, SC initially in January 2023 . We are very excited to expand to other cities early next year, so please reach out to us and let us know where you are located! We would love to have you sign up for our newsletter in the meantime to follow along on this journey and hopefully we will be available to download in your city soon. The newsletter and mobile app sign-up is located on our website below, and make sure to follow us on Instagram at @ safe.roam <newline>  <newline> [https://www.safe-roam.com/](https://www.safe-roam.com/);Distinct_Bumblebee96;False;7;0.98;2022-12-08 01:07:27;/r/AutisticLadies/comments/zfk9cy/studentled_mobile_app_startup/;autisticladies

565;ysh86f;I finally told my therapist that I think I'm autistic...;" ...and she said ""I'm so glad you felt comfortable enough to share this with me, because I have been wanting to bring up the topic of autism for a while and was just waiting for the right time"". She then proceeded to list some of my traits that made her suspect me being autistic, and said that many of my complaints about day-to-day life were the exact same complaints of some of her autistic patients. <newline>  <newline> To be quite honest, ""I think I might be autistic"" is kind of an understatement. I first heard about autism in women back in 2016, and the more I read about it, the more it felt like looking at my reflection in a mirror. Nothing had ever described me so well. But the few people I talked to about this never took me seriously. ""Oh, but you're so smart. You can't possibly be autistic"". ""No, you're normal"". I would always end up thinking something along the lines of ""yeah, maybe it's all in my head"". But the feeling of ""I'm pretty certain I'm autistic"" would always come back. <newline>  <newline> My therapist also said that, if I wanted to pursue a formal diagnosis, she would support me. And she would also support me if I chose not to. And honestly, I feel so happy, grateful and relieved. I was bracing myself to be brushed off once again while telling her of my suspicions. And she not only validated them, but said she had them too!  <newline>  <newline> This was the final push that I needed to finally go after a diagnosis. I had spent this entire time, from 2016 to now, saving money for one - but I was terrified of spending it just to then be told ""no, you're not autistic"". As of right now, I'm on the wait list for an evaluation at a clinic that specializes in autism in adults! <newline>  <newline> I have been going through such a hard time lately, and getting this validation from my therapist lifted a huge weight from my shoulders. If anyone is still reading this, thank you! :) <newline>  <newline> ♡♡♡ <newline>  <newline> **Edit:** A huge thank you to everyone who took their time to comment! I really, really appreciate your support. My therapist really is amazing - I found her through a website for people to find affordable therapists, where therapists who have a special price for patients with a lower income log their info and write a description about themselves. What made me choose this specific therapist was her love for cats (she talked about how she works as a volunteer in an animal shelter and has 6 cats), as I have two cats who are my everything. I also saw that her political values were aligned with mine, and she had an instagram post talking about autism in adults. This specific website is, unfortunately, based in Brazil only. But there probably are similar websites in your home country!";isbobdylansingle;False;11;1.0;2022-11-11 17:35:02;/r/AutisticLadies/comments/ysh86f/i_finally_told_my_therapist_that_i_think_im/;autisticladies

567;urkc7y;MEGATHREAD: Information Regarding Female Presentation in Autism;"A place to list and discuss links to research articles, blogs, or podcasts that discuss how autism presents differently in women (and anyone who identifies as non-cishet male). Most of us here are aware that girls/women/afab/genderqueer/NB//trans+ have traits that present differently than the stereotypical young, middle-class, white male diagnostic criteria of the DSM-V-TR. <newline>  <newline> It can be difficult for us to be diagnosed accurately. Sometimes it comes after years or decades of misdiagnosis or medical gaslighting by the medical community. It's important for us to share resources so we may become educated on how our traits may present differently than the stereotypical male traits that a diagnostic practitioner may be looking for. **The more educated we are, the more we can advocate for ourselves**. <newline>  <newline> Some articles about differences in presentation and why we're are often overlooked and misdiagnosed when it comes to Autism: <newline>  <newline> Are autistic females rare?: [https://embrace-autism.com/are-autistic-females-rare/](https://embrace-autism.com/are-autistic-females-rare/) <newline>  <newline> Girls and women with autism: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760407/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760407/) <newline>  <newline> Women with Autism: ""Too Much and Not Enough"": [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-autism-spectrum-disorder/202104/women-autism-too-much-and-not-enough](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-autism-spectrum-disorder/202104/women-autism-too-much-and-not-enough) <newline>  <newline> The lost girls: [https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/the-lost-girls/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/the-lost-girls/) <newline>  <newline> The Female Autism Phenotype and Camouflaging: a Narrative Review: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-020-00197-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-020-00197-9) <newline>  <newline> Why It’s So Difficult to Diagnose Autism in Girls: [https://slate.com/technology/2015/10/autism-in-girls-and-women-is-difficult-to-diagnose.html](https://slate.com/technology/2015/10/autism-in-girls-and-women-is-difficult-to-diagnose.html) <newline>  <newline> Girls on the Autism Spectrum are Being Overlooked: [https://ipmh.duke.edu/news/girls-autism-spectrum-are-being-overlooked](https://ipmh.duke.edu/news/girls-autism-spectrum-are-being-overlooked) <newline>  <newline> The Art of Autism - Empowering through the Arts: Females And Autism / Aspergers: A Checklist: [https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/](https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/) <newline>  <newline> ETA: Autism In Women: Here’s What You Need to Know [https://adultautismcenter.org/blog/autism-and-women-heres-what-you-need-to-know/](https://adultautismcenter.org/blog/autism-and-women-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) <newline>  <newline> 10 Key Signs of Autism in Women: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-autism-spectrum-disorder/202104/10-key-signs-autism-in-women](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-autism-spectrum-disorder/202104/10-key-signs-autism-in-women) <newline>  <newline> Finding the True Number of Females with Autistic Spectrum Disorder by Estimating the Biases in Initial Recognition and Clinical Diagnosis: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35204992/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35204992/) <newline>  <newline> ‘I was exhausted trying to figure it out’: The experiences of females receiving an autism diagnosis in middle to late adulthood: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1362361319853442](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1362361319853442) <newline>  <newline> Professor Tony Attwood - Autism in Females (an overview on how girls on the spectrum differ from standard autistic stereotypes): [https://vimeo.com/122940958](https://vimeo.com/122940958) <newline>  <newline> This post also has lots of resources on it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticLadies/comments/yw8tg0/a\_list\_of\_resources/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticLadies/comments/yw8tg0/a_list_of_resources/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) <newline>  <newline> Autistic Women and Non-Binary Network: [https://awnnetwork.org](https://awnnetwork.org) <newline>  <newline> Autistic Women: Why is This Still Challenged?

568;pb2jwb;Subreddit Rules (an initial guide);"Hello all! <newline>  <newline> Taking cues from the input of other users and communities, here are some ground rules for the sub to start us off. Please note that these are subject to change. <newline>  <newline> Also: I've heard that the AutismInWomen subreddit has been abandoned by the mods, but I don't see any indication of this on my end. If that's indeed the case, maybe we can reclaim the space and this community will be superfluous! <newline>  <newline> Without further ado: <newline>  <newline> **1. ""Ladies"" should be read as a broad descriptive term.** This sub should be a safe and welcoming place for autistic women, AFAB folks, those socialized as female, gender non-conforming, femme-presenting folk, etc--you do **NOT** need to be a cis woman or identify with the term ""ladies"" to participate here. <newline>  <newline> **2. Post titles should be descriptive.** We will work on getting flair for posts and users, but for now, please ensure that the subject of your post is clear in the title. <newline>  <newline> **3. No self-promotion or links to personal social media.** This includes blogs, YouTube channels, TikTok accounts, Twitter, Instagram, etc. <newline>  <newline> **4. This is a subreddit for autistic womxn and their lives.** This is not the place for neurotypicals to unload about their autistic family member or friend. It is also not the place for neurotypicals to request participants for studies or surveys of any kind, or to demand subreddit members educate you on autism. Do not use this sub to find autistic womxn to DM about such things, either--if you receive such a message, please message the mods so that we can ban that person. <newline>  <newline> **5. Self-diagnosis is valid.** We are not the gatekeepers of autism. Invalidation of self-dxed people will result in a warning, followed by a ban on the second offense. <newline>  <newline> **6. No racism, misogyny, or ableism will be tolerated.** <newline>  <newline> **7. This sub is anti-ABA therapy and anti-Autism Speaks.** If you're curious about the ways these entities harm autistic people, please consult Google. <newline>  <newline> **8. Diagnosis-related questions will have a weekly megathread.** This keeps common questions and answers related to autism diagnosis in a designated, centralized spot. Individual posts requesting information on diagnosis will be removed, though the mods have some discretion over this (if, for example, the post generates a big discussion). Hoping in the future to have a Wiki with diagnostic resources, potentially based on geography. <newline>  <newline> **9. No selfies, for now.** This is based on popular complaint due to the central autism sub having an influx of selfies at the moment, choking out other content. Selfies will be given a designated thread or day of the week in the near future, depending on the feelings of the community. <newline>  <newline> **10. Don't be a dick.** As autistic people we don't always have a social filter. Do be prepared for bluntness. Be as respectful as you can in comments. Comments may be removed for assholery. <newline>  <newline> I think that's it for now? **If you would like to be a moderator, please leave a comment below (or use modmail to DM) with a little about yourself (as much as you're comfortable sharing), whether you have any modding experience, and whether you're familiar with CSS (not a requirement, just looking to see if anyone would be up to making flair, maybe a community theme, etc.)**";noprods_nobastards;False;27;1.0;2021-08-25 02:59:26;/r/AutisticLadies/comments/pb2jwb/subreddit_rules_an_initial_guide/;autisticladies

570;ypzyqq;My mother blames my autism diagnosis for us not talking.;"A year ago, I finally stopped talking to my birth mother after escalating issues that arose from her not respecting my boundaries.  <newline>  <newline> I hadn’t cut her off. She could (can) contact me directly if she wanted, but instead makes comments on my Facebook posts as if we were still on good terms. I deleted any passive aggressive ones and simply didn’t reply to the rest because I don’t want to continue the cycle of being pushed and then pretending like nothing happened. I simply want her to discuss any issues with me like an adult. <newline>  <newline> She’s now getting people to contact me on her behalf — the narrative being that I’m mad at her for not bringing me up (I’m not) and that I’m especially cruel to her.  <newline>  <newline> In an email my dad forwarded me, she said she’d noticed my urge to “ditch” her had reached a high point when I started seeing my therapist and got diagnosed with Autism a few years ago. <newline>  <newline> In our last conversation (between my mother and I), she was asking questions about my therapy, assuming I’d said nothing but bad things about her, and talking about how it wasn’t “fair” for the therapist to only have one side of the story. The thing is, I barely spoke about my mother because she didn’t bring me up. The trauma I was trying to deal with was abuse from my actual caregivers. Besides, the point of therapy isn’t to document every argument that ever happened and who was right. It’s to grow as a person and to process traumas.  <newline>  <newline> She’s making so many assumptions about my therapy, including that I even talk about her (let alone planning to cut her off) that it may as well be a novel because none of it is based in reality. My therapist actually offered a FREE session with my mother to help resolve conflict, and my mother declined.  <newline>  <newline> Aside from this, I’m incredibly upset at her narrative as a whole. She stated that she couldn’t believe that “someone that came from me could be so cruel. I get the feeling that she is losing friends too, […] because I think she shows them very little more respect than she shows me. If my life is ‘going to shit’, then hers is too. I’m worried she’ll end up losing so many people."" <newline>  <newline> This was a confusing statement because I haven’t lost any friends since my diagnosis, and my life isn’t going to shit at all. I’m buying a house with my boyfriend, I got a decent paying job this year, and I’m thinking about coming off my anti-depressants. I don’t understand this story she’s telling. <newline>  <newline> She also seems to think that even keeping her as a friend on Facebook is cruel. She thinks my posts are purposefully designed to twist the knife because she doesn’t know the details of the things I post. Of course, no-one does. That’s the whole point of Facebook — to post about your life in general terms. She knows as much as anyone else I’m friends with, including my dad, his ex wife, and his current wife. No-one knows where I’m moving to unless they’re talking to me directly, which she isn’t.  <newline>  <newline> I actually get nervous thinking she might look at my Facebook, not hoping for it due to some sick satisfaction that’s she’s not really in my life. I’d prefer to unfriend her but that’s what felt like an unnecessary cruelty at this point. <newline>  <newline> The rest of the email is further insults about my personality (that I haven’t matured past being a toddler and that I’m cruel) and revisionist history about the last face-to-face interaction we had, which I could list here and rebut but there’s not any point. <newline>  <newline> I’m upset that she’s using my therapy and diagnosis, which helped me have a better understanding of myself and more compassion for myself — something that helped me — as a terrible and negative thing. How can I reconnect with someone who thinks of me and my progress in that way?";BusyTune9;False;10;0.94;2022-11-08 22:02:04;/r/autismgirls/comments/ypzyqq/my_mother_blames_my_autism_diagnosis_for_us_not/;autismgirls

572;x8feen;Wim Hof Breathing method increases epinephrine temporarily, which can permanently decrease TNF-alpha inflammatory biomarkers which are increased in autism; <newline> Research 1: Autism creates increased bio inflammation markers including TNF-α and I-6 corresponding to autistic symptom severity.  <newline>  <newline> “Neurobiological studies in ASD have highlighted pathways involved in neural development, synapse plasticity, structural brain abnormalities, cognition, and behavior. In addition, abnormalities in the cellular immune response have also been reported in children with autism: in particular, reduced cytotoxic activity and elevated levels of selected proinflammatory cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL1β, have been shown to disrupt neurodevelopment [3, 4]….. <newline>  <newline> Microglia cell activation is a prominent feature of autism, and there is a complex interaction between microglial cells and cytokines. Wei et al. found that IL-6 elevation can modulate autism-like behaviors through impairments of synapse formation, dendritic spine development, and neuronal circuit balance [7].” <newline>  <newline>  <newline> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4333561/ <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Research 2: <newline> Wim Hof breathing exercise temporarily increases epinephrine in the brain, which reduces TNF-α and IL-6 which are inflammatory biomarkers.   <newline> Thus having potential to reduce autistic symptom severity.  <newline>  <newline> “This  increase in epinephrine levels correlated with an increase in levels of anti-inflammatory messenger molecules (called cytokines) like IL-10, and a reduction in levels of proinflammatory mediators, like TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8.” <newline>  <newline> https://scienceofparkinsons.com/2020/02/06/wim-hof/ <newline>  <newline>  <newline> TLDR: Wim Hof method, which involves a controlled hyperventilation, increases epinephrine temporarily which can actually decrease the bio inflammatory markers which are directly linked to autistic symptom severity and inflammation.;kelcamer;False;26;0.95;2022-09-07 20:21:01;/r/autismgirls/comments/x8feen/wim_hof_breathing_method_increases_epinephrine/;autismgirls
573;usmfte;What are your experiences?;Hello! I've been researching autism (a lot), trying to figure out whether that's me or not, cuz it certainly seems to be. <newline> However, there's a few things that I don't experience (that much), and those seem pretty significant. I was wondering what your experience is like  <newline>  <newline> * Eye contact <newline> I am quite conscious about eye-contact in longer conversation, but it's not like I really can't bear it. Also, in small talk, I find myself naturally looking at the other person's eye quite often (I think both to show I'm listening and to see if the other is smiling) <newline> - in YouTube comments, I only see people that talk about any eye-contact as a sort of torture, is this a thing for all autistics? <newline>  <newline> * Playing <newline> I did not really line up my toys (only stuffed animals, really) and I did often play pretend (although it was always the same events, borrowed from series or what my older sister did or things I wished I could do myself but wasn't allowed). <newline> - is the lining up of toys instead of playing pretend something all of you do? Do autistic people really not play pretend? <newline>  <newline> * Sensitivity <newline> I myself and my parents have thought (since young) that I was more sensitive than others. However, I have never had a meltdown because of sensory overload, and although I often consciously note every sound I hear, I can easily get lost in a train of thought and stop noticing what's happening around me. This might be a coping mechanism, but also proof that I'm sensitive but not that sensitive. <newline> - how does this work for you? <newline>  <newline> This was a quite long post, so thank you already for reading it. I hope you could help me out by answering any of the questions, my mind has been very confused lately ^^;rOsalieej;False;7;0.88;2022-05-18 20:49:08;/r/autismgirls/comments/usmfte/what_are_your_experiences/;autismgirls

576;10e1q25;DAE unintentionally make themselves mad or frustrated with random scenarios in your head?;I tend to think a lot in the shower, both positive and negative things. Sometimes even analytical things (I’m a history and philosophy junkie).  <newline>  <newline> But sometimes I think of really random scenarios in my head, for example, I thought about a frustrating encounter with my aunt (we have very very different views of the world). I haven’t spoken to her in years, but I see her post things on Facebook and I was randomly thinking about what would happen if a specific topic came up, and basically played it out in my head. I feel kinda nuts… only cause this is the first time I’m ever telling someone or even acknowledging it.  <newline>  <newline> Please tell me I’m not alone in this.;KrispyKreme-502;False;10;0.96;2023-01-17 03:36:42;/r/AutismWithinWomen/comments/10e1q25/dae_unintentionally_make_themselves_mad_or/;autismwithinwomen
577;10diann;Is this autism?;Last year (by last year I mean 2021 oops) I started a BA program. One class was like a “presenting” class. In that class were a few people from different BA programmes. <newline>  <newline> Now I just got a follow request on Instagram from a guy who was in that class. He was not in my program. I only went to that class 3 times, and after that I didn’t go because I quit the program (so also the class) <newline>  <newline> For your information: my Instagram is really hard to find. I really don’t know how he found it as he doesn’t know anything about me (except maybe my first name and the BA program I was in, but neither of those are on my Instagram) and we never talked. <newline>  <newline> I don’t know if it’s the autism but I feel like my reaction to the follow request is not really normal, as I am really really really creeped out. I have been thinking about it non stop for 2 hours now. The fact that he found me a year later, without having talked/knowing anything about me, having seen him only 3 times, not following/knowing anyone I know SCARES ME SO MUCH  <newline>  <newline> How can I get out of this feeling? Rationally, I know my reaction is not normal but it feels so real to me and I’m scared;fufjfjdjfjfj;False;9;0.93;2023-01-16 16:05:03;/r/AutismWithinWomen/comments/10diann/is_this_autism/;autismwithinwomen

The diagnosis increases my fear of not being accepted. However, the diagnosis has brought more self-respect and an understanding of my need for recovery time. I have found solace in reading books and drawing.   <newline> >   <newline> >\- Anonymous Autistic Women’s Group member   <newline> >   <newline> >I found being diagnosed lead me to feel like I'd been cursed with something and I found myself asking why me? As time settled down, I realised that half of the things I struggle with are not my fault and in those harder moments I was far kinder to myself. I also believe the world needs people with differences to offer a different perspective and am very comfortable with my diagnosis, I went from ruminating because I told 4 people now? To telling people confidently when the moment is right.   <newline> >   <newline> >\- Anonymous Autistic Women’s Group member   <newline> >   <newline> >The feeling I had after the slow painstaking process of self-diagnosis was one of relief and being able to arrive at an explanation. I was able to contextualize my struggles and was able to give myself the grace to accommodate them.   <newline> >   <newline> >The most profound grief has been when I have brought this experience to others who I trusted. Some dismissing my ""need"" for a label (hey, if it explains it it explains it, I'm not hung up on a label, these characteristics exist before it and without it), or expressing disgust towards autism and wanting me to distance from it (yikes! that's uninformed and problematic) or gesturing towards everyone being on the spectrum (I'm fairly certain most of us hold that there are discrete bounds to who is and isn't autistic) or dismissing it without any educated cause (camouflage and making ""eye contact"" aren't actually disqualifiers).   <newline> >   <newline> >Quite recently my self-diagnosis has brought me guilt when reconciling the venom from certain members in reddit's autistic community who feel that those who are self-diagnosed (and usually less outwardly obviously autistic, after all they were not caught earlier) are following a tiktok fad, ruining the label and somehow lowering their chance for support. I am so pained that this is causing such unnecessary strife to people who are already enduring a lot. I understand it (the aggressive group feels encroached upon) and really don't understand it (truly, no one is taking anything away).   <newline> >   <newline> >\- Anonymous Autistic Women’s Group member   <newline> >   <newline> >*Did/do you feel any grief after discovering you are autistic? What were/are the reasons for it?*   <newline> >   <newline> >Completely. When they told me in the evaluation -- they didn't even wait til i got the report -- i burst into tears and immediately demanded a second opinion. The reasons were: a) I felt I had been demoted from humanity into something ""other"" and defective: b) i worried i would no longer be of any use to my friends, because if i don't function, percieve, or think like them, i couldn't be a useful friend: c) i had to mourn the lifelong hope that one day, if worked hard enough at it, i would fix all my psychological problems and be normal. Finding our my diagnosis was finding out this would never happen.   <newline> >   <newline> >*What things did/do you think about while in this grief?*   <newline> >   <newline> >Same thing I do whenever I enounter a problem -- I researched. I read tons of memoirs of autistic women and accepted that the diagnosis was correct. I also read a ton of books about how autistic symptoms can be mitigated, and began to figure out what I might need such as occupational therapy.   <newline> >   <newline> >*Was/is this grief different from others in your life, or similar?*   <newline> >   <newline> >Much milder. I was never as attached to anything about myself as I was to the people I loved who died.   <newline> >   <newline> >*What helped/is helping you with your grief? Time, therapy, talking with other people, other?*   <newline> >   <newline> >Time, OT, and the word takiwātanga. It's the Māori word for autism, it was coined from words meaning ""in his/her own time and space."" I learned it early on and it helped me feel that maybe i wasn't just a failure in the ""normal"" world, i might have a world of my own that could be worth something. for quite awhile that eased my self-hate quite a bit, and i became more gentle with myself knowing that the struggles throughout my life had not been because I was stupid, lazy, or bad. It's up and down now though.   <newline> >   <newline> >*Is the way you process grief post-discovery different from how it was pre-discovery? If so, how?*   <newline> >   <newline> >I've never really been able to process it. I get ""complicated grief"" for years and years and then just go cold. This new grief has been easier to achieve acceptance.   <newline> >   <newline> >*What other emotions did you feel besides/along with grief? How did they relate to the grief?*   <newline> >   <newline> >Who knows, I have alexithymia.   <newline> >   <newline> >*Anything else to add?*   <newline> >   <newline> >I'm really, really glad for this topic because I am not one of those who found it to be a relief.

I feel the urge to educate on the topic of autism because of my own story. I had to go through two very very horrible burnouts that lasted for many years and I almost lost sight on one eye from the unimaginable stress of having had to function in a life that just wasn’t working for me. None of the approximately 20 professionals I went to during these years of burnout had the idea I might be autistic, so I conclude, that education about autism is much needed. In therapies I even said things like: “My brain works in strange ways.“, “I don’t seem to be able to communicate what is going on inside me with others. Sometimes I don’t find any words at all and can’t speak“, “I feel so different than everybody else. I think there might be something going on with me that doesn’t have a name yet. Maybe in 100 years they will have a name for it.“   <newline> >   <newline> >Advocating for autism doesn’t give me very many positive emotions, because I make myself vulnerable (people project so many of their own things into my content and me, that isn’t there. I get misunderstood sometimes) and social media can be so unforgiving and aggressive, even on the leftist side and even from the autistic side. But I feel I HAVE to do it - I am a bit obsessive about it -, to bring my autism from shame to pride, to learn to understand it and to love it. I HAVE to do it, to constantly remind myself that my undiagnosed autism isn’t something private or negligible, but maximum important and worth the attention for the sake of finding energy to live again. And I HAVE to do it from fear to neglect myself again and jeopardizing my health because of it (I might be too hard on myself here, because I burned out both times NOT KNOWING I was autistic or what my true needs were).   <newline> >   <newline> >\- Anonymous r/autisticwomensgroup member <newline>  <newline> **Sharing on the following questions:** <newline>  <newline> * Share period I (to about 35 min past the hour): What does the phrase “autism advocacy” mean to you?

It turns out that people are a huge special interest for me… at least, certain people are. In high school I used to follow certain boys around, stalk their AIM profiles (this was before Facebook) and even walk past their houses if they lived in my neighborhood. I also tried to get as close to them as I could. I would chat with them on AIM and try to establish connections in real life. Like I took guitar lessons from one of them even through the main interest was him and not the guitar. At these times, my life is really defined by how much access I can have to these people. My friends also participated in this and we did it as a group, but looking back I think it was more serious for me than it was for them. It feels great in the moment but looking back it was really pretty creepy on my part (the guys never did anything creepy even through I think they know they must have seen us giggling around them). I wish I could apologize but that would probably be even more creepy, and I don’t really want to interact with any of them again anyway. At least now I know what the warning signs are and can prevent myself from falling into those kinds of patterns now (they also naturally started to abate when I really started having boyfriends).

There’s still a prideful place in me that stings when I acknowledge that “I don’t have very many” friends, but my “adult brain” knows it’s for the best, because the ones I have are the ones that are stable, supportive, and not exhausting for me.

I want a doctor that won’t inject their biases into my healthcare.  <newline>  <newline> These shouldn’t be big asks, but *gestures at everything* plus I love in a deep red state… not much more to be said about that. <newline>  <newline> The thing is, I don’t have any clue how to do this anymore. For my last doctor, I asked on a local facebook group, but I don’t use facebook anymore, so that option is now out. <newline>  <newline> So what process do you neat people use to find a GOOD doctor when you’re on the hunt? How can I avoid wasting my time on shitty docs? I’m not down to try them on for size and decide later. It’s hard enough to make myself make one appointment, let alone as many as it would take to “shop around.” <newline>  <newline> Thanks in advanced for your time, energy, and memes.;oneandahalfdrinksin;False;0;0.81;2023-04-06 21:18:52;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/12dydjc/how_to_find_a_good_doctor/;twoxadhd

587;124ayll;I need a way to organize/declutter that actually works for my forgetfulness and object permanence issues!;I do not own a lot of belongings but I have a habit of making “Doom boxes” I have issues with object permanence which I think is common with adhd BUT- growing up in a hoarders house/family members are all hoarders I never really learned proper organization, everything was just in piles from floor to ceiling so I pretty much don’t notice until my floor is covered in clothes/pockets are emptied all over the house. I watch YouTube videos and a lot of things are not one size fits all!  <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what to buy to organize I feel like a lot of it doesn’t fit my needs and I have to see almost everything or I trash my house. I also think some of the fancy organizing things are a waste of money and are hyped up to drive consumerism. <newline>  <newline> I would like to add that recently I did a whole house “reset” and put everything away but it rarely lasts long because I get frustrated and can’t remember where something is even if it has a designated place and once again trash my house or several other dumb reasons like I got uncomfortable and took off my pants somewhere in the house and forgot about them. <newline>  <newline> I have dogs so my house isn’t totally trashed, everything is out of reach so they don’t eat anything dumb but it’s the little things that pile up and drive me insane. I can’t organize in a neurotypical manner I’ve tried, but being confused on what I need also doesn’t help. <newline>  <newline> I have some ocd tendencies that are a whole other issue, like I have the same number of shirts/pants and if I notice I haven’t used or worn something I donate whatever it is. With that set number of clothing if I buy something new it’s strictly for replacement purposes- I think it’s due to the fact my mom’s main thing to hoard was clothing and I can’t handle having more than I NEED. So I’m very need based also, which I’m aware is contradictory to adhd but I am not formally diagnosed with ocd and the compulsive behaviors are linked to CPTSD and it’s a coping mechanism so I don’t “become like my mom” in my head. <newline>  <newline> TLDR: I have issues organizing my house mainly due to adhd object permanence/generally being forgetful and disorganized. I have issues with compulsive decluttering from my mom being a hoarder, it’s a CPTSD self soothing mechanism. I’m not sure where to start, I ‘reset’ my whole house to see what works for me but I would like advice or tips on what works for other people to help me try and get my life together.;Sensitive-Hospital69;False;12;1.0;2023-03-28 03:19:39;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/124ayll/i_need_a_way_to_organizedeclutter_that_actually/;twoxadhd

590;11sgvlo;Overwhelmed with hairstyling;"Hey, <newline>  <newline> This might be a tad bit long - I'm not sure yet. I need to give a little bit of a backstory, I suppose - so, my mother is half Puerto Rican and she has curly, Spanish hair. However, she was adopted by a white family and I think they didn't really take any time to learn how to treat her hair. She never really knew, nor does she know now, how to do anything more than a ponytail. Growing up, my aunts were the ones that would braid my hair and style it. When we grew distant from my aunts and I was more of a teenager in control with my hair - I just kind of left it as is. Just my hair - but brushed (usually). My oldest sister would sometimes do buns, my middle sister had the fluffiest hair ever and never really knew what to do with it other than a ponytail. Eventually, she shaved it. I am now the only one in my family with long hair - besides my mom, who also just usually leaves her hair as is. <newline>  <newline> As of now the only thing I feel I can successfully do is ponytails and I've had increasing anxiety and overwhelmingness surrounding doing anything with my hair. My husband is black and only just recently cut off his dreads - so for three years, he had long hair and would style it in different buns and hairstyles. He has tried in the past to suggest me to try buns and whatnot. I would start to try - watch a video or read an article, try a few times and when I wouldn't get it, I would give up. It's like, if I don't get it in less than four shots, it's too overwhelming and I give up. Watching videos, I always feel like I miss some steps, but reading articles always feels like I'm missing something. Sometimes I just feel like some women have some sort of magic that allows them to just get it and style their hair. I feel like I'm missing that and I don't know if it's just because of how I grew up, or if maybe ADHD is involved as well? I know I tend to give up easily and I generally attribute that to ADHD and my lack of patience and inability to accept that I'm not perfect. I like to just ""get"" things and do things my way. I struggle with reading directions and often just try to do it myself - but then I usually end up with overly spiced food, or a chair that doesn't stay together, or a hair style that looks straight out of a yearbook photo for Wacky Hair Wednesdays. <newline>  <newline> Today, my husband and I were experimenting with hairclips because it seems like something EASY. We watched a Tiktok over and over again and I tried to replicate and I just...didn't get it successfully and I ended up crying. I don't know. A part of me feels like hair is an essential part of womanhood and I missed out when I was a child because I didn't have many girl friends and once we became distant from my aunt, I had nobody to ask or help me through those steps and it feels deeply embarrassing at 25 to ask my friends for help doing a bun or braiding my hair. So I don't know if it's trauma, ADHD, or OCD or a mix of all - or something. I just feel so...overwhelmed by hair so I procrastinate doing anything and just continue with just brushing it and getting by. <newline>  <newline> Yet still, every now and then I want to mix it up and surprise my husband. Or just be like other women? And yet I feel like I can't. I just get frustrated, overwhelmed, and upset. So I give up and stop trying. <newline>  <newline> I just want to know if anyone else struggles similarly? I feel so alone and so silly for being so deeply upset by this.";TheWhisperedthing;False;14;0.95;2023-03-16 02:02:05;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/11sgvlo/overwhelmed_with_hairstyling/;twoxadhd
591;10k2dnt;ADHD guide on how to reduce Internet and Social Media usage (ADHD Friendly);"Since  a lot of people asked on another subreddit, I thought people would like  a follow up from my post of yesterday. Here is how I drastically  reduced my internet usage: 2 years ago, I was spending **48 hours on my phone per week** and have now reduced to no usage (besides reddit to spread the word that, yes, it is possible and **I wish someone had told me that way!)** <newline>  <newline> **Bold letters for ADHD reading** <newline>  <newline> **1. What is too much internet usage?** <newline>  <newline> 1. Internet usage nowaday is difficult to measure: **any amout that makes you feel uncomfortable** or that something isn't right in your usage is enough to understand that **it's too much**. <newline> 2. Don't be ashamed to **measure it**: I was 48 hours for me. So basically, **I was throwing away my weekend every week to internet usage.** <newline>  <newline> **2. First steps before:** <newline>  <newline> 1. You may not have noticed, but **something in you changed : you are aware.** Don't worry, this feeling won't last and it's ok. **You will realise it over and over again** and its all part of the process. <newline> 2. **Treat it as an addiction** (see picture (taken from [http://garethmartin.hubpages.com/hub/The-abstinence-verses-the-harm-reduction-model-of-addiction-treatment-contrasted](http://garethmartin.hubpages.com/hub/The-abstinence-verses-the-harm-reduction-model-of-addiction-treatment-contrasted), consulted on 24.01.2023). <newline>  <newline> **3. Understanding internet usage** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Treating it as an addiction is not too far from the truth:** We talk about it all the time how addictive it is, it is important to recognise it as such. <newline> 2. **It   is not 100% your fault: Apps have more money invested into them than   you ever will earn in a lifetime, and now YOU feel guilty you can't   quit?**  Realise your part and the part on the app, and let me   tell you, you are less at fault than these ingeneers who want to make   money off of you. <newline> 3. Luckily, **there is no physical withdrawal, so the struggle is firstly habitual and mental.** <newline> 4. **Habitual because you have it as a reflex** and **phone usage is close to fidgeting for us** (this is key for us ADHDer and why it seems we are more prone to addiction, even if the problem is global) <newline> 5. **Mental because many things will arise from you.** <newline> 6. Using the internet is often called ""escapism"" and that for a reason, **we numb emotions through it.**   In my experience, it was a way to add a break for my brain, but what I   realised only a couple years after I was addicted was that it was in   fact **tiring me and overstimulating me.** <newline> 7. Acknowledge this, it doesn't have to always be so precise, **but just seeing that: ""Ah, I am feeling THIS now"" is sufficient for progress.** <newline> 8. **You phone will be an important tool** in this process. <newline>  <newline> **4. Preparing your phone for a ""Phoneless day"":** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Add your calendar on the front page of your phone and write in for one week something like ""Dopamin detox"".** <newline> 2. **Silence all notifications** that are not necessary (I.e Instant messages, Social media). **Keep your phone and SMS on and tell your close ones you are doing this challenge and to contact you per these if it is urgent.** <newline> 3. Want to go one step ahead? **Delete your apps accounts and delete the app from your phone. Replace all of the apps with website links (See 8. Resources)** <newline> 4. Congratulations, you have now no reason to use your phone but for emergencies. Let's see on how to do a phoneless day! <newline>  <newline> Tips: <newline>  <newline> 1. **Timers on apps won't help.** I've tried it. If you have mild addiction, it could help some people as I've heard, **but   severe addiction and this timer is a snooze button! It will make you   feel as if you are in control but you really aren't. If you pressed it   more than once as a snooze, recognise this. It is ok.** <newline>  <newline> **5. Example of a day** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Wake up, touch my phone and getting into the addiction loop.** <newline> 2. Each day, at a different time **I would realise** I was scrolling endlessly **(Happened several times per day, each day)** <newline> 3. **As soon as I realised, I closed the app/website** <newline> 4. Check in with how I felt: ""**I was scrolling because I feel (...)""** <newline> 5. **If   it's a bad brain day, just acknowledge how you feel, or that you were   in fact, scrolling and try to do something else. If it doesn't work,   allow yourself to SCROLL! The issue might be deeper and you might need   scrolling as an escape mechanism in some hard situations. And that's Ok!** <newline> 6. If It's **a good brain day: ask yourself, ""Why am I scrolling?"",**   This will make you look for solutions and try to justify that   behaviour. Example: ""I am scrolling because I feel lonely, and seeing   other people achieve things in their pixel perfect life makes me feel   happy for them"" BUT ALSO: ""I acknowledge I feel more lonely and also   inadequate"". **Give yourself time for that, you DON'T have to know everything and some days the answer is ""I don't know"".** Trust me, it will come with time. <newline> 7. **Look   at my calendar and remind myself why I am doing this: for myself, for   my privacy online but also because I yearn for more than just being   sucked into the internet.** <newline> 8. Rinse and repeat. Allow failure, but **recognise why it's important to fail to get better** <newline>  <newline> **6. Oh no, I relapsed and it has now been 5 days... How to keep going after relapses?** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Relapses   WILL happen. Sometimes more often, sometimes less. What matters is  that  you try again. Did you do 3 days? Well done! That's already  amazing.  Did you only manage 1 day this time? Don't worry, you managed  it better  another time and can repeat it!** <newline> 2. Acknowledge that it is quite a road and that things **will REPEAT** as in the addiction wheel until you exit it or reduce usage. **It's a wheel because you keep repeating the same pattern and it is an addiction.** <newline> 3. **A relapse is not the end of the world:** at the beginning I thought I was stuck, **but each time I held on longer and that was progress.** <newline> 4. Every time it happens, remind yourself that it is all part of the process. After only a couple of weeks **I understood what peace felt like.** <newline> 5. **Remind   yourself why you do it, again: You do it because you remember a   phonefree time and things were more peaceful to you. It is hectic, you   get sucked in and you don't stop.** <newline>  <newline> **7. Emotions arising/Sensations:** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Guilt:** ""Why didn't I leave sooner? """"Sh\*t, I'm on it again!"" <newline> 2. **Shame: ""**""I am not able to follow through\*\*"" ""**Other people can do it better**""\*\* <newline> 3. **Sadness:** ""What's the point in trying? I keep going back"" <newline> 4. **Boredom:**   Less for ADHD as the overstimulation can be too much and will make us   actually enjoy the off time. People who can focus their attention  better  might use their phone ""Just so"" and boredom is definitively a  reason  why. <newline>  <newline> But also: <newline>  <newline> 1. **Pride:** ""I did it better than last time"" <newline> 2. **Peace: ""So this is what being with my own mind again feels like"" (Can be hard to face!)** <newline>  <newline> Important funfact: <newline>  <newline> 1. **Leaving cold turkey makes you feel guilty and makes you also return faster on your phone! Go on progressively.** <newline>  <newline> **8. Resources** <newline>  <newline> 1. **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS):** They helped me so much. **Imagine   no ads, no tracking and no infinite scroll. Using FOSS websites or   Software makes it so much more easier: They don't need your data, so   it's basically early internet!** <newline> 2. **USE OFFICIAL INSTANCES! You can also check the code if you are tech savy.** <newline>  <newline> **I am not sponsored,** but here are the apps and websites I used: <newline>  <newline> **Libreddit**   (website) - Reddit replacement: no tracking, no ads, you can download   things and also no infinite scroll. I used it a lot. Made the  experience  easier to quit. Dark mode makes it more likely for me to  leave. <newline>  <newline> **Invidious**   (website) - Youtube replacement, no tracking, no ads, you can download   things. Some even have blank starting pages, so you only look for what   you want. <newline>  <newline> **NewPipe (app) -**   Youtube replacement, no tracking, no ads, you can download videos and   music. This is still my go to: You can customize it and even remove   thumbnails and suggestions, remove the trending front page. I never got   lost on youtube again and now only watch what I truly care about. **IMPORTANT**: **Download it from F-Droid only! Safer this way.** <newline>  <newline> **Bibliogram** (website) **-** Now discontinued, it used to replace Instagram quite ok. Was useful at the start. <newline>  <newline> **Nitter** (website) **-** Twitter replacement, no tracking, no ads but eh, you know, it's twitter. <newline>  <newline> I have no replacement for Tiktok or other apps, but if you know of FOSS apps for those, tell me and I can add them to this list. <newline>  <newline> These apps are free to use and you can check their source code if you want to. <newline>  <newline> **That's it for now, I am open to questions, but first I go to sleep**";ItsApricotTime;False;13;0.93;2023-01-24 10:20:29;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/10k2dnt/adhd_guide_on_how_to_reduce_internet_and_social/;twoxadhd
592;10i673p;Medication thoughts;Today I called in for my prescription to be filled and yet again the answer was that they can’t get it.  <newline>  <newline> As I researched for answers, some of the responses indicated that there has been a huge uptick in those with ADHD, and that some of those that were diagnosed more than likely didn’t have ADHD, but they so now the figured that the majority of us then are simply abusing these medications.  <newline>  <newline> My question is, why would anyone take more of these meds than needed?! I have accidentally taken two instead of one and felt absolutely awful. I couldn’t do anything. I literally had to lay down on my bed after taking a shower and scrolled though the internet and Instagram for two hours. The entire time I felt like I couldn’t move. In fact, it felt way worse than typical ADHD paralysis. I can’t even adequately describe the horrible cement-like feeling that took over not only my body, but also my brain. My total dose was only 20 mg.  <newline>  <newline> So, how do people feel while abusing these meds? How do they function? I seriously want to understand because I’ve never ever felt high on them.  Plus, to further confuse, I read the science that indicated that stims affect those with ADHD and those without ADHD, similarly.  <newline>  <newline> I’m just truly stumped by this.

594;yidpga;Maybe rejection-sensitivity-related but I’m really sad about something and feeling stupid about how sad I am.;**TLDR**: *I was cast in a lead role in a community theater play based on a popular film. The character in the film is blonde/light-colored-haired white, as are the character’s family members. I am Hispanic. I have seen others play this role on stage, and in other variations of it, and not all of them have been white or had blonde/light hair. I genuinely didn’t think I would be cast because I didn’t look very white and have brown hair, but I got this role and was so happy, especially because everybody else cast in the family had brown hair. I was happy because the community was going to be getting a slightly different-looking version of the story than they’re used to, and I think that’s a good thing. Then I found out yesterday that they’re going to give me a wig and spray blonde hair spray in the hair of my brown-haired cast mates. I cried about it a lot and I feel really stupid for it.* <newline>  <newline> —— <newline>  <newline> So I did theater all through middle school high school, and then majored in theater performance in college.  <newline>  <newline> I grew up and went to college in a predominantly Hispanic region of the US (I am also Hispanic), which was great, because it really put no limit on what roles we could get. For women, this meant Cinderella, Snow White, and Ariel are all played by Hispanic women. Lady Macbeth, Hispanic woman. Traditionally white role? Doesn’t matter. They’re gonna be played by Hispanic person because that’s who is auditioning. For that very reason, so many of us in the theater program at my college did not attend college further north from our border region because we knew it was gonna be harder for us to get roles in things. Plus, we loved our community.  <newline>  <newline> Fast forward 15 years and I am currently living in an area of the country where only about 3% of the population is Hispanic. We have a great/popular community theater, and I’ve always wanted to audition for it, but never tried. I was just always too scared. However, my daughter has recently gotten really into it, and so she and I went ahead and auditioned for a play at the same time. <newline>  <newline> Well, wouldn’t you know, I got a lead role! (She did too!) Amazing, right? I won’t say what the play is for anonymity-sake, but it’s a stage adaptation of an old movie, and everyone in the movie is white. So, I really just auditioned for my daughter and was very surprised that I got a part, being obviously non-white. <newline>  <newline> Of course I’ve had a ton of thoughts like, “They would have picked someone else if the audition pool had been larger,” but everyone who auditioned was also so great, so I talked myself out of that belief and started believing I got cast because I truly fit the director’s vision for this character.  <newline>  <newline> At the first read-through when we were introducing ourselves, I even brought this up. I mentioned that I had in fact seen a lot of diversity in this particular theater, which was one of the things that had encouraged me to go ahead and audition (true).  <newline>  <newline> As time went by, I even got excited because every single member of the cast had brown hair. (Granted, only one person with blonde hair auditioned.) I told my husband how it’s gonna be so great for this community to see this famous story unfold in front of them with people who look different than they would expect. If only slightly.  <newline>  <newline> Well, yesterday I met with the costume designer, who excitedly told me that my “wig had come in, and it was so cute!” <newline>  <newline> My stomach dropped. For one, I didn’t expect to wear a wig (and I HATE wigs) however, I’ve worn crazy stuff for the theater and played crazy roles, so that in and of itself not a problem.  <newline>  <newline> I think the problem is just that for weeks now I’ve been feeling happy because everyone in the family had brown hair. We don’t look like the family in the movie. I loved that. And I loved that my daughter was getting to see me perform in a lead role even though I don’t necessarily look the same as the person in the movie. I always want her to be able to see a character and dream of playing that character even if she’s a different color than that character. And she was gonna get to see that. <newline>  <newline> But this wig is light colored hair, so that I can look more like the person from the movie. And they’re gonna put blonde spray coloring in the other people’s  hair. <newline>  <newline> I’ve seen clips on YouTube of my character being played by women with brown hair, and even one well-known woman of color. <newline>  <newline> It was so embarrassing because I literally couldn’t hold back my tears talking to the costume designer. I told her how excited I was that the family was going to have brown hair, but that I could also play ball and I had faith in her decisions. (And I do. Things can be two things at once.) The costume designer is also a woman of color. The director, however, is not. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, the costume designer told me that on Tuesday I can borrow the wig and bring it home to try to get used to it and see the different ways I can style it. She really wants me to feel confident. I’m not worried as much about feeling confident/attractive. I’m just really sad because I don’t really wanna be whitened up. I also understand that as an actress, I’m meant to disappear, and that’s completely fine … I guess I just wish I had known beforehand just how much they want me to disappear. <newline>  <newline> I’ve been sad about it since last night, came home and cried a bunch about it. Cried more about it this morning. I’m really going to try this wig and maybe, hopefully get into it and help the Director bring her vision to life. But I don’t know, I just feel sad, and stupid for feeling sad. <newline>  <newline> I just wish I hadn’t gotten excited about being a brown woman cast in a traditionally white role. I wish I had known beforehand that they were gonna whiten me up. There are just so many other productions of this where the woman has brown hair, in spite of the fact that the woman in the movie has blonde hair, so I assumed they were OK with a family that looked a little different than the movie. But I guess not. I might’ve still auditioned had I known, but I would’ve thought about it more.  <newline>  <newline> Now I genuinely feel that they wouldn’t have cast me if they had someone else in the audition pool who looked more like the character from the movie.;arizonabatorechestra;False;43;0.97;2022-10-31 14:28:05;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/yidpga/maybe_rejectionsensitivityrelated_but_im_really/;twoxadhd

Nor have I ever seen a more willingly uneducated group giving fact-of-the-matter advice.  <newline>  <newline> It is very much “if it hasn’t happened to me, it’s non-ADHD related. Stop slacking.” And i’m concerned that their ignorant rhetoric is causing vulnerable ADHDers to spiral further. <newline>  <newline> It’s devastating to see an entire demographic raised to believe that a lack of control over their disorder reflects a moral failing—especially in a space designed to safely air your concerns. Maybe it’s because they were never given empathy in their time, who knows? I’m just very appalled.;NadjasGhost;False;69;0.98;2022-10-01 07:10:01;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/xsorqr/do_not_join_facebook_adhd_support_groups/;twoxadhd
598;xgubjy;My choices in fashion style and the music I listen to is strongly connected to the time of year and the weather.;"I'm really not sure how to begin to describe this quirk of mine lol. <newline>  <newline> I'm into alternative fashion and sport a wide range of aesthetics. I love them all fiercely and take great joy in creating different outfits and not feeling restricted to one look , but most of these have strong associations with certain times of the year and/or certain kinds of weather (e.g. sunny vs. cloudy). For example, when I'm in the mood for a gothic look, I am more likely to put together something with a less saturated palette [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/alternativefashion/comments/sla4f1/had_a_chance_to_play_around_with_makeup_yesterday/) in the winter, and one with a more saturated, highly-contrasted palette [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/alternativefashion/comments/xcs6oq/holy_shit_talk_about_a_throwback_this_fit/) in the summer. <newline>  <newline> Same thing with music. The number of genres I listen to is just HUGE: trance, DnB, nu-disco, trip hop, jazz, metalcore, ambient... But the great majority of music I listen to in the summer falls into genres like dubstep and disco house, and fall and winter is reserved for genres like progressive metal and chill hop (aka ""lo-fi"" lol). <newline>  <newline> The thing is that I don't just have a slight propensity to dress a certain way or listen to certain tunes depending on the weather, I also will actually feel *uncomfortable* if I do the reverse and contradict these associations. There are some genres of music that I absolutely CANNOT listen to during certain months, like for example jazz during the summer makes me feel BLEGH (there are exceptions though). Conversely, the thought of having blonde hair in the winter (one side of my head is bleach blonde and I cycle through semi-perminent colours throughout the year) makes me feel dysphoric\* in the weirdest way. Now, I wouldn't go so far as to describe this discomfort as debilitating. Usually it only amounts to me contorting my face [into this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/880/450/dfa.jpg), and at most, I feel momentarily irritable, depressed, and/or anxious. However it's a strong and persistent enough experience that it makes me highly doubt that it's something the average person deals with. <newline>  <newline> Years ago, I bought an adorable neon orange scarf from Ardene on impulse but I have literally only worn it once: It dawned on me at some point that the kind of weather that *requires* a scarf is also *not* the kind of weather in which I feel inclined to don neon clothing lol. <newline>  <newline> Is there a name for this eccentricity? Does it speak to any ADHD symptoms or traits? (Perhaps ""trait"" is a better way to label it, since it seldom actually causes any distress to me.) What the hell is it?? It makes me think of something you might find in ASD but I'm not on the spectrum and have never considered that I may be. Please help me understand myself better, fellow ADHDers. 😊 <newline>  <newline> ^(\*NB: I am referring to dysphoria in the general sense here, not gender dysphoria. I noticed that most people on social media nowadays only recognize this term in the context of transgender experiences, so I thought it might be prudent to clarify.) <newline>  <newline> Edit: As I mentioned in one of my comments, yes, I do have synesthesia also. :3 So ya I do think there's a good chance this is related to that.";CukeJr;False;18;0.9;2022-09-17 18:45:43;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/xgubjy/my_choices_in_fashion_style_and_the_music_i/;twoxadhd
599;xeyk8f;ADHD win!!!;Last month the mother of one of my daughter's classmates made a comment on my Facebook that made it clear that she did not understand ADHD, especially how it shows up in girls. I responded with what I thought was a very measured and polite explanation of some common misconceptions, but when she never answered I spiraled. I must have offended her. Now she'll never want my daughter to hang out with hers. It's going to be awkward at the next parent gathering...the whole thing. I talked myself down, but it was always in the back of my head. You know how it is. <newline>  <newline> This morning she emailed me and said that she thinks her daughter might have ADHD too and could I help her understand where she can get some help and what the processes are? <newline>  <newline> Holy crap my friends! Here I thought I messed things up with just having to say my piece (*internal eye roll*) and she took all that info, synthesized it, and we might have one more girl that gets the help she needs early. <newline>  <newline> Nobody mind me.

600;xd7rgh;Advice on medication timing;I am taking Vyvanse. It works amazingly well for me at my office job 8-5ish. However, it does not seem to last long enough to continue working when I get home. <newline>  <newline> It's not just tiredness. I feel awake, it's just the lack of will to do anything. It's been so bad I don't even like scrolling the internet which is a change from normal. I kinda just want to sleep but I'm not tired. And I don't think I'm depressed. Anxiety is pretty low compared to where it usually is. About all I can manage is watching TV because I can't even concentrate long enough to scroll reddit or Pinterest. Let alone clean or do laundry etc. <newline>  <newline> Would increasing my dose help, or taking it later in the morning? I'm afraid if I do either of those it will affect my sleep. <newline>  <newline> Thoughts, suggestions? Different meds if you also generally responded well to Vyvanse? <newline>  <newline> Also- if relevant, I'm early 40's but postmenopausal due to cancer treatment.

601;x9j2tm;hoping worrying over nothing but both my spouse and I have ADHD and take simlat medicines but get go itetae Gwen I questioned him about him taking more then I said he could of mine to hold him over;I hope I'm over worrying feed back appreciated ( haven't spoken to me since yesterday) <newline>  <newline> I posted this in the ADHD form nothing. Woke up this more my spouse still hadn't come home no communication nothing.  After the weirdness. He didn't get irritated really  irritated untill I questioned him about him taking most of medcine but the really part I didn't mind the few but it was more the half this go around and then. When I questioned him about him  not telling me he picked it up.  I remember him saying he picked up wellbrutrin but didn't have time to go pick up the other. They didn't thave time I remember that phrase. He got really upset. And lashing out about other problems in our  life.  Next day said we were over and selling the house I'll post what posted below but just work up nothing not a word and hasn't been answering his phone or messenger. Ps I've been a stay at home mom had freelance clients but again this summer had been pulled into his family business he took over I'm not on the books only he is. But I've down just as much work I've been there and Delt with a lot. We agreed we were all in and apologized for both of us what we did int he past. I also found out he not taking his or is out of his foloxutine?sp last time he missed a dose he lost it and flipped out on people. His own family member she 18 and was working for him still refuses to apologizes to her.  But I don't know. Like it makes me worried also I noticed he had a nose bleed the other day he didn't before never got thms before that I noticed never.  He was acting off. <newline>  <newline> Edit  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> What I posted before it long: <newline>  <newline> So I'm not sure if it's best to try and type this out or use the voice feature I just saw but let's go with typing. <newline>  <newline> My spouse and I both have adhd. I was diagnosed in my 20s. He said he was diagnosed before we meet and we had issues with added and ADHD medcine before he'd gotten addicted. . Fast forward to now we have a our rocky inter personal issues( verbally not so nice and mood swing on his part)  when were happy we a re really happy as long it just the three of us and no outside interferences or input for others or distance. There other issue we both did wrong. And apogiazed for.  <newline>  <newline> I'm not perfect he's not perfect just say that now to be clear. <newline>  <newline> So Iv been prescribed ADHD medcine of and on over the years most don't work for me or make me evil ken evil or a zombie or super irritated and snappish.   But Adderall just works super chill and focused.  Few times I went to sleep. My current primary looked at me like iw as crazy like you must really have it bad.   But my husband was against and harassed me so hard over the last year called me names druggies telling other people I was going to be an addict or I was taking drugs it was bad on top of everything else.  <newline>  <newline> Now he finally took one of mine and that convinced him it works. He at first told me he didn't then I found a few only 2 or 3 in his bag. Just be upfront about it   but you have to go get your own script. Which he did go to the doctors except insurence kept blocking it and requesting prior authorization. So while he wait for his to be approved he took a few oh mine to hodl him over which was fine it though you'll just replace the ones you took from me with your script and it will equal out and I don't take it constant intake breaks. Bc I was on it and XR. I prefer the ir XR isn't the best for me personally I feel to long to keep and and the anxiety drop is more sever for me.   <newline>  <newline> We finally got the script but we had pay out of pocket and find a pharmacy that was done with that And then the shortage happened so by now like currently he had two of his own bottles filled I think. And he was due for another one and insurance was again cause problems so I said I didn't mind. But I ahd asked him to pick up my medicine including another one that wasn't Adderall bc I had to head up and out to work.  Well he does the one the ir I have to ask for it. Before when he have few of mine he ask and I gave him what I could spare so he'd be ok and could function and get through the day. He was extremely tired an exhausted even before he started taking Adderall . Mind you.  But any way 5 here for the week and I'd put back in my purse. Well he picked the ir this time Iaks him for it he gives to me and I'm like dude where did it Go. I have 13 left outta 30. He like my script isn't filled I need to get throught he day. Which again I didn't mind but this felt different he didn't ask he didn't tell me what he was doing up front. Ok  firn I said ir works best for me if you have to use a few untill your script is use the XR I don't care if you use more of those if you need bc it's less effective for me and it you really need and you know you have a script it not problem. Bruh I didn't tell you you have the whole bottle at least I didn't think so. But  another time he said he picked up the non adder med but did have time to go to the other pharmacy for the XR ok fine few dYs lTer I go to pick it hoping it didn't expire I know it's a pain in the ass for my doctor's to re write.  They say it was already picked up I said no I got a texts. Low and behold he picked up and I know my memorys bad but I do remember him say he didn't have time to stop to pick up the other medcine the XR.  If I'm mistaken I'm sorry but why didn't you say anything was my issues. If I heard right ND you did say you isn't have time to pick up but then you did and told me you didn't. It makes me uneasy. I called him and said what going on do I need to argue with he pharmacy  did you pick up bc you said you didn't have time to when I asked at least that what I thought I heard him say( he can have me doubting myzelf I have Brian dog out the wazoo at time sand bad memory but that it stuck out at me bc I was worried about it expiring again or something but again maybe I'm wrong) but he was upset about something else I was supposed to do but same time he asked be to do another things and I had drop out child off to school so it was obvious I couldn't do that other tj ok g he wanted and pick up his medicine as well and make it in time for the things he needed me to do and I thought he understood that from me the texts messages.  He frusted but not irate And annoyed.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> But then he changes when I ask him about him picking it up. Defensive then agner then bring up me not being reliable And doing as we agreed. But same time you asked me to do xy and z.   No way I'd make it in time and we were communicating and everything and not sure how it didn't click or what was lost in trans lation. Now he mood swing another way again and not he saying stuff like we over and about putting our house won't the market and bring up infidelity on my part but also he admitted to it way before and said we were over mutiple times and a ok some  other crazy thing those times correlated with new medicine I was on and not excuse but a huge factor in in combined with his behavior and my mental state. <newline>  <newline>  But let just say I don't drink while taking wellbutrin and I've only switched to a certain manufacturer of it the item rone's caused crazy side affect and those incidents I was decided not me. The wine I drank wich was barley any  half a cup to a cup. Just sipping. Side affect so weird felt like it didn't happen like it wasn't really. He bring this like that up after we have been fine and we both apologized for what we did and he admitted that he was a big factors in what happens and how he had be treating me nothing I did was good enough ever even admitted that to our marriage therapist. But lately he been back tracking ont hat and not taking accountability like eh was before on past behaviors. ( And around those times he was constantly threaten divorced and saying all types of messed up things and that we were over and threatening to take out some and this and that it was bad. And I was already depressed which I never had to medicated for that untill then and he was along with members of his family were huge factor in that.    <newline>  <newline>  But he bring that up but I asked  why did you tell me you didn't pick it up when you did and I had to find out that way. ( I'm still starting to doubt myself if I headed wrong but I'm very sure I didn't  he said we didn't have time to do xy and z I know that) that he changed and got irate an distracted and lashed out with that and the nexts day say that we are over and done  then blocked my calls and said I should stay down he and him there and we're not compatible.... He done mood swing before but I also realized he hasn't been take and is out of on of anti depressants and hadn't picked it up since June or July said the pharmacy when I asked.   <newline>  <newline> Should I be worried I feel like confronting him set him off and had him push me away like that hurtful and stress fil I'm also stay home mom. And I've been pulled Into the family business . But I'm not on the book and I'm helping him.  I can't get a job or when I tried he took the keys when we had a fight and I lost the role bc I couldn't show fo the interview. Another time  is when I have my own gig work  and my client canceled bc he was sick of our meeting falling threw bc of him the client or me bc I get pulled in last minute to the family business or his stuff or mom and life stuff but his reactions to things makes so much harder. Especially when he gets funky with folks. And alienates people. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Pps: posted in other forms didn't get to much of a response someone recommended women ADHD thread no clue there was one.  <newline>  <newline> .I still haven't heard from him. After he said putting house on market and we are over and it obvious it's over. Ia texts and then nothing no calls answered on messenger or texts or phone. Probably ly blocked my calls again.  He didn't shut down untill I questioned him then he comes back with this. .. I'm trying to not let my anxiety kick in. Hard core. Or be sad or sprial.  I need to be mom and be effective I e cleaned the house bc I was the one working where he was so nothing was down he made attempts I think but the house was a wreck.

604;w9f10t;surviving limbo while I wait for an official diagnosis.....;"Writing this on impulse, like much of my non-lurker Reddit behaviour. I guess I'm trying to connect to those in a similar situation, or who have gone through it. Because it feels like I'm in limbo and stuck in a state of life paralysis, cycling through various emotions internally while doing absolutely f***-all externally....  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> My story is like many of yours. Perpetually wondering what the hell is wrong with me, why I can't keep up with being a functioning adult when so many others find it so easy. Everything's a chore and if I'm honest, the prospect of another 30/40 years of this fills me with more and more crippling dread and misery every day.  <newline>  <newline> I had a ""breakdown"" almost a decade ago, diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been on SSRI's ever since. I hate them and their side effects and think they're completely useless.  But something never really sat right with it, despite working through acceptance and against the stigma and misunderstandings of mental health, depression and anxiety.  <newline>  <newline> Funnily enough, creepy social media algos figured me out, pushing various ADHD / neurodivergent content, specifically from women, and, while I silently chuckled daily at how relatable these memes and tiktoks were, one day I suddenly had a lightbulb moment of ... ""Oh shit. I may have... I have ADHD!""  <newline>  <newline> Suddenly everything clicked. About me. About my behaviour. About why I am the way I am. About my family and how I've definitely inherited it from my father and how many of his faults were because of it.  <newline>  <newline> It was a rush of emotions, but mainly, I felt vindicated, I felt seen. And I finally know what ""to feel seen' means. I was suddenly granted some sort of pass to be kinder to myself, although this is still a journey to work through after three decades of feeling inadequate.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> The process to official diagnosis is long, requires constant follow up and is tricky to keep momentum going. I've managed to find alternatives to the NHS's 24 month waiting list (ikr), and through the Right to Choose legislation, I've managed to find a clinic that has a significantly shorter waiting list to be assessed -- 6months. I'm 1 month in and I'm exhausted.  <newline>  <newline> Going private isn't an option as I can barely make ends meet as is. Not to mention the little voice in my head saying that it could very well not be ADHD and therefore I'd have wasted a huge amount of money and be back to square one.  <newline>  <newline> I still have commitments and things that I need to do. I need to make money. I need to keep up with my career, as my industry is blowing up. Also once I get assessed, IF I really do have ADHD, I still have to go through a whole 12 month process of finding the right treatment. I can't wait and I'm stuck in this excruciating state of paralysis and procrastination about anything vaguely important (e.g. my weight, my desire to stop smoking, eating better, long overdue dental work, where my next contract will come from, training/ certification I need for my work, etc etc etc.)  <newline>  <newline> Life can't just stop and wait while I figure my brain out.  <newline>  <newline> You bet I've researched and consumed every bit of content I come across, help guides, tips, tricks but nothing is really translating to action.  <newline>  <newline> I am quite literally sitting twiddling my thumbs with a storm of emotions and thought spirals (not all bad) going around. I'm worried I'm seeing this diagnosis as some beacon of hope, where everything will get better then, which I know is not how it goes.  <newline>  <newline> I guess I want some reassurance and perhaps any advice you may have that can help me during this time?  <newline>  <newline> Christ, I've even considered microdosing illegal stims to get me through. 🥹 <newline>  <newline>  Thanks for getting this far if you have.  <newline>  <newline> TL:DR: I finally came to the realisation that my depression and anxiety and general disdain for living is probably the result of undiagnosed ADHD. I am waiting to be assessed, but am now in a state of life-paralysis but still need to be doing things to make a living and... Don't know what to do.

605;w6cqfn;ADHD // Unemployment // Life Purpose;"Hi there, i'm glad you're all here. this reddit page has given me a lot to think about, and i'm grateful for all of you. i've tried to write a post here many times before, but i typically spend too much time trying to *perfectly* articulate my situation, get deep in the weeds of it all, and then give up before i even figure out why i'm here and what i need to ask. this time i'm trying to care less about perfectly doing anything, and just keep writing. i hope i can communicate myself clearly enough to get to the point.  <newline>  <newline> I left a high-stress career in journalism after experiencing severe burnout (working 9-12 hrs/day, on call on weekends, never took lunch breaks... etc.). This deeply worsened during the pandemic, of course, but more importantly after the sudden death of a mentor whose absence i was never able to grieve, but after which i needed to manage the logistical fallout. I am proud of myself for leaving the job when I could -- my mental health was at its breaking point. At first, I wanted to just 'take a break' for a while. I gardened a lot, slowed down, and finally took time to grieve my friend. Six months later, i started going to therapy and was quickly diagnosed with adhd/autism. i have now been unemployed for over a year and this is the longest i've ever been without a job.  <newline>  <newline> I am utterly lost. everything feels hard and nothing feels worth it. I've started applying for jobs again recently, but everything I come across seems to fall into three buckets: 1. boring/ pays minimum wage 2. insanely stressful or 3. something i'd need to go to school for 5 years to be qualified for.  <newline>  <newline> Everyone tells me: ""you're so smart and driven and can truly do anything"" but: being smart doesn't attract HR algorithms: I think my being ""driven"" was actually just me hyperfocusing and masking, and I can't access that motivation anymore: and the infinite possibility of ""you can do anything"" is crippling to me right now, not empowering.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Um, so, questions:  <newline>  <newline> 1. **Career support:** Does anyone know of any resources for neurodivergent individuals who are looking for jobs and are struggling to identify where to even look, or what industries to go into? I'm still going to therapy but my focuses are different there.  <newline> 2. **Digital struggles:** Does anyone else struggle with... the tyranny of the digital social sphere? I needed to take a break from social media last year. And while it's been really beneficial for me, it seems like my lack of a digital presence is isolating me from whatever community i used to have (even if i never truly felt connected to the feeds), and may even be hurting my chances of being hired, in the sense that i've withdrawn from the digital networking activities like... posting on instagram or liking someone's photo.  <newline> 3. **Medication:** Is there anyone else who is not on medication but is... idk.. living a fulfilling life and is able to manage their adhd in a healthy way?  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> A note about **support** \-- I have a few very close, but long-distance friends, and a romantic partner who is really supportive. But all of these people identify as neurotypical and don't really understand this aspect of me, though they are trying.  <newline>  <newline> At the end of the day, i am looking for a **purpose**. I think I stayed in my old job for so long because even though I was succumbing to unhealthy work habits, I was needed every day and never had to question what I was going to do that day -- my purpose was absolute. I don't want to go back to that. But I do want to get up in the morning for a reason other than -- feed the cats, feed myself, watch the sun move across the sky, get groceries, avoid cleaning.   <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Thank you for reading.

607;vl96ul;Internet addiction;Does anyone else have or has overcome internet addiction? <newline>  <newline> Last year I recognized I had an alcohol problem, and after trying & failing to moderate my drinking, I concluded that I had to completely abstain from alcohol. I’ve been sober ever since and it’s been relatively easy. Changing my environment helped tremendously. When I was an alcoholic I was single and lived down the street from a bar, so it was easy to fall into a routine of walking to the bar after work. Then I met my now husband (who’s a non-drinker) and moved in with him, and we are not within walking distance of alcohol. I replaced going to the bar with spending time with my husband, and any time I feel an urge to drink I’ll drink a mocktail. I abstain from alcohol and replace the time spent at the bar with other activities so it doesn’t feel like there’s something missing with my life.  <newline>  <newline> But internet addiction feels different. Specifically Reddit, Twitter, & YouTube. I’m not like Level 10 addicted where I spend 100% of my waking life online, but I probably spend like 75%? I have a 9-5 WFH job, and I’m constantly taking work breaks to scroll. When I eat I have to have a YouTube video playing. I bring my phone into the bathroom and scroll on the toilet. At night & on the weekend, if I’m not running errands or doing an activity with my husband (hiking, visiting friends/family, dog park, street fairs), I’m scrolling my internet feeds.  <newline>  <newline> I scroll for the dopamine hit. I just started Adderall, and am hoping it will help quell the urge. Can anyone relate? Maybe I should limit & schedule scrolling time to like an hour a day? It’s so baked in to my everyday life that it’s hard to imagine how I would even spend this new free time.;TryIcedTea;False;5;0.98;2022-06-26 17:00:18;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/vl96ul/internet_addiction/;twoxadhd

(I'll accept applause for this achievement 🤣😜) <newline>  <newline> If you are interested in joining us (especially if you are interested in DMing so I don't have to) please comment and let me know what your timezone & availability for a game is!  We can set up a ""session zero"" and meet to make characters and establish ground rules so everyone is comfortable playing.  <newline>  <newline> Looking forward to meeting you all! ❤️ <newline>  <newline>  <newline> EDIT: If I have replied to your comment and you have NOT received a chat from me with the discord link, please reach out! I'm trying to get thru and reply/invite everyone.  <newline>  <newline> ALL AGES AND EXPERIENCE LEVELS ARE WELCOME! <newline>  <newline> I am going to try and organize as many groups as I can and possibly some one-shots for those who don't want to commit to a long-form game. There WILL be a text-only game for those who are socially anxious! <newline>  <newline> Still looking for DMs to help get all these ladies playing DND!  <newline> THANK YOU ALL AGAIN!";AdMost9917;False;209;0.97;2022-06-15 19:37:47;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/vd2s1h/all_women_all_adhd_dnd_group/;twoxadhd

612;uw6xas;THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts;This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to.  <newline>  <newline> Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!! <newline>  <newline> Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes.  <newline>  <newline> I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it.  <newline>  <newline> The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why.  <newline>  <newline> Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Here are some links about BWRT to get you started: <newline>  <newline> - https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21339 <newline>  <newline>  - https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/showthread.php?209740-Brain-working-recursive-Therapy <newline>  <newline> - https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts: <newline>  <newline> - https://psychonoclast.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/1-part-1-the-history-of-my-early-contact-with-the-linden-method/ <newline>  <newline> - https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2057 <newline>  <newline>  <newline> (FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.) <newline>  <newline> ———————————————————————— <newline>  <newline> EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/) <newline>  <newline> “The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims. <newline>  <newline> In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems. <newline>  <newline> The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence. <newline>  <newline> The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.” <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> …Thoughts??;fuckedupdreamerx;False;3;0.97;2022-05-23 18:31:03;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/uw6xas/therapy_scam_alert_bwrt_brainworking_recursive/;twoxadhd
613;uw1wg3;Feeling anxious;**TW if you don’t want to feel afraid of taking meds don’t read, friends** <newline>  <newline> A little while ago I was sent a tik tok about someone with adhd who takes vyvanse (the same meds I take) and he was being lighthearted and joking about how he takes like 70 mg of vyvanse (I take 40mg) and how it’s going to cause him an aneurysm by age 28. I would have just laughed but my medication making me sick or causing me to die a sudden death in my twenties is something I’m actually anxious about. But just like the guy in the tik tok, Vyvanse makes me function so I don’t want to stop using it.  <newline>  <newline> And today, maybe like a week after seeing that tiktok and having it surface in my brain to bother me a couple times, I took my meds like usual and started playing animal crossing to wait for it to kick in and my heart starts pounding. This of course makes me think of that tiktok, and now I’m anxious. I got up to get a yogurt for some reason thinking it was happening because I hadn’t eaten anything, and my arms start feeling weak and it’s hard to swallow but I can’t tell if that’s because I’m upset or because or something else. After like half an hour my heart feels more calm but I can’t help but feel like having random heart palpitations isn’t healthy, and I wonder if I should stop taking vyvanse. <newline>  <newline> When I first started taking meds I went to the doctor pretty often for them to check me, like my blood pressure and such, and it came back normal. Before and after starting medication I’ve had super healthy blood pressure, and I can imagine that’s because I’m 21. I haven’t checked in a couple months though, and what if I’m ruining my blood pressure by taking it, and I start having problems in 10 years?  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, vyvanse has been super life changing for me and helped me control my binge eating and get through my insane last semester of college with honors cords on my shoulders, and I know that adulthood only gets harder from here so I don’t want to stop taking it. Writing this post helped me calm down a bit more but I guess I want to know you guys’ experiences too with medication, and if you think I’m right to worry.;ItsZing;False;6;1.0;2022-05-23 14:47:36;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/uw1wg3/feeling_anxious/;twoxadhd

615;upko84;Not doing well today. A Rant;I've a bit emotional this week about some thing unrelated to my ADHD, so I was already struggling. Then Thursday came and if you saw my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/up11um/guanfacine_immediate_release/), you'll know Thursday didn't go well either.  <newline>  <newline> So, there's been a class action suit against Facebook on behalf of Illinois residents because their face recognition software violated Illinois' privacy laws. Back in 2020, I saw an ad for a law firm saying I should file a claim. I clicked on the ad. But now I can't remember if I actually clicked submit after I filled out the forms. I don't remember if I chose a paper check or PayPal deposit.  <newline>  <newline> Last night, the local news station posted that checks had started to be mailed on the 9th, and a lot of people commented that they got their checks on Thursday. Well I didn't check mail Thursday or yesterday, so I was thinking maybe I got it without knowing.  <newline>  <newline> I had to go to the store so on my way out I checked my mail. Nothing in the box. I started sobbing in the lobby of my apartment building.  <newline>  <newline> I'm just so sick of having untreated ADHD. My memory is so fractured. I barely remember my childhood, only the really significant things. Anything before 5, gone. I can't focus on anything. I feel like a hummingbird flitting from flower to flower. And I'm effing livid that I have to make a choice between my brain and my excruciating neuropathy pain. I'm an angry crier and I can't stop crying now. I'm holding on to my sanity by my fingernails.  <newline>  <newline> Seeing a different psych doctor is not an option. I don't live in a city, I live in a town with 23,000 people. There's no other psych doc here or in Rockford (closest city to me) that takes my insurance.  <newline>  <newline> I really want to punch a wall right now. <newline>  <newline> Thank you for reading.;AllyriaCelene;False;6;1.0;2022-05-14 16:20:47;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/upko84/not_doing_well_today_a_rant/;twoxadhd

Just recently I’ve stumbled across a woman’s ADHD page on Instagram and every single video feels like it was plucked out of my head. It’s legit tripping me out. I’m learning things about myself that I thought were exclusive to me. Turns out I’m not alone… I’m not diagnosed though. Never been to a dr because I didn’t know there was an issue- always masked it with recreational drugs and alcohol - you know a “functioning addict”  Never been to a therapist because I grew up in a home where therapy was for the weak…. I know that I need to see a dr. I guess… I just felt the need to post this because I’m trippin extra hard about it tonight.;PoisonGlitter;False;4;1.0;2022-05-14 07:16:21;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/upbvet/_/;twoxadhd
617;up8eer;Stopping meds, need your help and tips!;I (26F) was diagnosed with severe adhd a year ago, and now I want to stop taking concerta because it’s taking a huge toll on my liver and the effects aren’t too helpful anyways. I want to go full meds-free for various reasons: 1. I live in Japan and already tried the adhd meds that are available here and none have helped: 2. I hate the idea of having to take these for the rest of my live, having to go to my psychiatrist so often, etc etc.  <newline> Instead I want to implement some long-term changes in my life that could balance my symptoms. <newline> The symptoms I most struggle with are: procrastination and inability to start “big” tasks, short attention span, inability to focus, impulsivity (especially when it comes to finances), talking too much and interrupting others, overall low self-esteem and imposter syndrome.  <newline> I read so much about all kinds of productivity hacks for adhd, or self-help books like atomic habits or the 5am club, watched so many videos about people’s adhd-friendly apartments and such, but nothing helped. I even used to be really into meditating (vipassana) for a while and it was actually helping but it didn’t last long and now I’m unable to start again. It’s like I know the theory of how I can make myself into a more productive, well-balanced person but it’s impossible to actually put into practice because of my severe adhd. Also the therapists here aren’t very helpful (I tried several different places) and only repeat textbook advice, so that’s not an option. <newline>  <newline> I want to be more like my high school self - the symptoms were there but they were nowhere as severe as now. I want to be able to function more efficiently, with minimal procrastination, I want to be able to maintain a habit for more than a couple days (like meditation or reading before bed), I want to be less dependent on cheap dopamine (looking at you tiktok), I want to be whole again :( <newline>  <newline> Can you share your favorite tools, strategies, routines, or systems you found useful in addressing your symptoms? Preferably, share your every-day, tried and tested systems that don’t necessarily regurgitate the same old advice like “break your task down into smaller bits, keep a habit tracker, count to 3 before you interrupt someone” etc. <newline>  <newline> I’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do… Meds either don’t work or don’t work very well, the usual tips don’t seem to be doing much either.

621;tjm6g1;Just listened to a podcast about ADHD telehealth startups;Posting here bc this would probably get deleted for some dumb reason on /r/adhd. Anyway, this “investigative reporter” was reporting on TikTok ads for Cerebral and the others and was really dismissive of adhd saying the symptoms were basically “the symptoms of being an adult in a pandemic.” And then they made it sound like people can just go in and demand they get adderall and the providers are helpless but to give in to their demands:  and finally compared the rise of adderall prescriptions in the last several years to the opioid crisis. I could not roll my eyes harder.

622;ti1ovm;Any project managers in the room?;Hi! I’m a year into my role as an associate project manager for a software company. I help customers implement our products. Even after a year I’m just really struggling with project management skills, to the point I’m like why did I think I can do this?! It kind of feels like it requires a set of skills I fundamentally lack as someone with adhd and low key autism. I’m watching this linked in learning thing about project management skills, and it’s all about planning, committing to the plan, and sticking to the plan. So things I’m THE WORST at…  <newline>  <newline> I think I need a mentor or buddy that’s a PM and has adhd and that’s not at my current company so I can be honest about my weaknesses.

Or maybe it’s just comments on this thread with things learned.

623;tgk7sp;Oh the places you'll go... mentally, when you're trying to focus on one thing;Hi friends. I just needed to post as I am laughing at myself. <newline>  <newline> I was putting my piles of clothing on hangers somewhat successfully... when I saw a stain on a light coloured shirt. I'd heard of people doing cool natural dye jobs to hide stains and refresh old clothes. So I needed to grab my laptop to do some research into that. I thought about all the invasive plants in my neighbourhood, and how if they had dye properties that would be cool. The first link on my google search was a youtube video of a basket weaving method using the invasive plant. I watched the whole video (skipping ahead obvs), and decided I needed to make them and sell them at the market this summer. I then had to google different ways of using woven baskets. Then, I decided to collaborate with another local artisan who makes ceramic fairies, to make little woven hanging fairy houses. Now...... I am on reddit posting about it. ahhhh! <newline>  <newline> I did my yoga class this morning, I'm well fed, I had a reasonable amount of caffeine, I got lots of sleep, I'm not on meds but like otherwise am feeling pretty calm and centered. And yet here we are. <newline>  <newline> On a positive note I'm super stoked about the concept of these baskets and have been looking for something to fidget with while watching tv at home so there's like a 20% chance I might even make one.

624;teah3e;How to fix a car: Standard vs. ADHD;"I had to replace something called the ""blend door actuator"" (I had never heard of it but youtube is wonderful) which is part of the HVAC system.  <newline>  <newline> Standard instructions: <newline>  <newline> 1. Disconnect car battery <newline> 2. Pull out glove box <newline> 3. Use a 7/32"" socket wrench to remove two screws <newline> 4. Disconnect the electrical harness (not sure if this is the right term) <newline> 5. Pull out actuator <newline> 6. Put in new actuator <newline> 7. Replace harness <newline> 8. replace screws <newline> 9. reinstall glovebox <newline> 10. reconnect batter <newline>  <newline> Here's a little how MY experience went: <newline>  <newline> 1. Watch a youtube video on disconnecting batteries <newline> 2. Go outside and open the hood <newline> 3. Realize I don't know where my phone is, and go back inside. <newline> 4. use the tile on my tv remote to buzz my phone...phone was outside the whole time. <newline> 5. return to car battery and realize I need to find a socket wrench that fits. <newline> 6. Search for the right sized bit, and eventually give up. <newline> 7. Try numerous other tools to try to loosen screws, finally succeeding with some pliers. <newline> 8. Try to pry open a panel underneath the glove box, and eventually give up. <newline> 9. Watch beginning of a youtube video on replacing the actuator and realize I was trying to open the wrong thing. <newline> 10. Pull out glovebox <newline> 11. Realize I don't have a correct sized socket wrench for actuator screws. <newline> 12. Search everywhere for the right bit, leaving a tornado of random tools in my wake. <newline> 13. Finally give up and decide to go to hardware store. <newline> 14. Use pliers to reconnect battery. <newline> 15. Go to hardware store, buy correct bit for actuator. <newline> 16. Start walking to car, and realize I should have bought the right-sized bit for the battery bolts also. <newline> 17. Walk back into store, start to the right aisle, then realize I probably have the right one at home after all. <newline> 18. Go home, find correct bit for battery which was with my husband's bike stuff. <newline> 19. Disconnect battery. <newline> 20. Realize I have no idea where I put the bit I just bought. <newline> 21. Look everywhere, and finally find it mixed up with other bits. <newline> 22. Try to move on, and realize I don't have a ratchet which fits the bit I got. <newline> 23. Decide to go back to hardware store, and can't find my phone. <newline> 24. Give up on finding my phone. <newline> 25. reconnect battery <newline> 26. Drive to hardware store to get correct ratchet. <newline> 27. Pick up my son at tk, since I ran out of time. <newline> 28. return home, track phone with tile (outside again) <newline> 29. attempt to disconnect battery and realize I've once again lost the ratchet/bit for that one <newline> 30. find ratchet, disconnect battery. <newline> 31. Finally unscrew actuator. <newline> 32. pull out harness <newline> 33. Realize I don't know how to get it out <newline> 34. watch another part of youtube video <newline> 35. pull out actuators <newline> 36. try to pop the new one in, give up after many frustrating minutes <newline> 37. watch some more of a youtube video <newline> 38. Finally figure out how to align and replace actuator <newline> 39. reconnect to harness <newline> 40. try for about 20 minutes to replace the almost impossible to reach screws. <newline> 41.

625;t86z1e;I just realized that this one thing that bugs me in my relationship is because of RSD;My partner doesn't like being in pictures and videos. He also doesn't share any pics and videos he has of himself from his past. The only ones I've gotten to see are the ones where he's a baby. Anything older than that is a locked box. I only get to see those if his friends or family share them with me. So I can't see old memories and I can't make new memories with him. It doesn't matter if it's a special occasion. He will cover his face or run away. I have zero photos of us together. <newline>  <newline> To add fuel to the fire, one of my hobbies is photography, and I'm excellent at portrait photos, more so at candid ones. He has me bring my camera to family events so I can capture those. I have done numerous proposals, engagements, save the dates, birthdays, holidays, work events etc, upon request of other people, on top of my usual travel photos and such. I'm not a professional by any means and that's what makes it fun. <newline>  <newline> I've asked him numerous times about what it is he dislikes. He's a good looking guy and has a great body. He is not insecure about himself at all. I promised him I will never upload or show any photos of him or us online, and they're for my eyes only. Heck my Instagram is super inactive and I only upload when other people ask me to. All he says is it makes him uncomfortable. <newline>  <newline> It sucks. Every time he shoots me down for a photo, a part of me dies. It doesn't matter if it's my birthday and I just want a photo with him. Any attempts I've made, he will cover his face or just look downright disappointed. Or purposely fake smile where it looks horrible. I only have pictures of him with me walking behind him, taking a photo without his knowledge. None of his face. <newline>  <newline> It makes me feel bad about myself. Like I'm not good enough for him to sacrifice 3 seconds of comfort for, for a picture that I will cherish forever.  <newline>  <newline> Fine, atleast show me pictures of you from the past. Nope, won't happen. I have to ask his family or friends and they will send me their copies. He only properly smiles for family photos because his parents arrange for a professional photographer to come in once every few years. He has a great natural smile in all of them. I have never heard him complain about those, but his family tells me they have to make sure he's on board every time. But then I don't get to see those. Not through him anyway. <newline>  <newline> Every single time this happens, all I feel is I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough to take photos of him or with him. I'm not good enough to see pictures of him. I'm not good enough to create memories with. Therefore I must not be good enough for him. <newline>  <newline> It crushes me every time it happens.  <newline>  <newline> He doesn't have great memory, so I know he will forget every thing we do together without pictures. He already has. I apparently have the need to have physical reminders of memories because of ADHD, and learned that recently thanks to that article posted about ADHD and hoarding, and people's comment about how they need physical reminders otherwise they will forget. <newline>  <newline> I'm just venting.

I was certain I would flank. But, beyond getting this grade, what I really wanted was once and for all understand Chemistry, even if a little bit. So, I took note of all the stuff I should know and went online to study on my own (shout out to [The Organic Chemistry Tutor] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA) who was basically my teacher) and I kid you not, in *less than a week* I managed to learn enough to pass. It wasn't a pretty grade, but it's done! <newline>  <newline> Hyperfocus really is something else. I've said before and I'll say it again - I can learn anything *if it's interesting enough for me to hyperfocus on it*.;lil_rhyno;False;3;1.0;2022-03-04 13:42:57;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/t6j8me/all_hail_the_might_hyperfocus/;twoxadhd
627;t629cd;This is all overwhelming. School looks so scary;"For the 2022-2023 school year I am going to go to this hybrid school. I will go to a school on Mondays with teachers and they will give me ""homework"" to complete and bring back the next week. I want to go. It will give me the structure I need. . <newline>  <newline> This school has a dress code. Each section has a certain color you have to wear etc. In high school the girls can wear skirts and skorts but boys can't wear shorts which I think is sexist AF. Anyways, I already can't find anything anywhere that fits me. And I don't have a color style dress code. It doesn't matter where I look I can not find anything that fits or looks good. Every store looks like the designer scrolled through tiktok and then mass Produced it. I am tall and not very big. I mean I am not skinny but I am not ""thick"" either. But it seems if you're not ED thin or unhealthy obese or ""ThIcK"" then 🖕 u. It is so damn hard to find anything. Biden's bottle neck isn't helping either. I don't care that my mom ""Had the same issues"" she isn't me. She isn't dealing with it right now. Her having the same issues 27 years ago isn't fixing the problem. <newline>  <newline> It's so big. Like I am going to get lost before I even get in the door. All my life the only thing I have needed to know is how to get down the stairs. Now I am going to have to figure out where lockers are, and I have to go to a different room to eat. Where all of these class rooms are. I'll have to like cling to someone to get around like an damn idiot. <newline>  <newline> My mother has neglected my education since my grandmother screwed everything up. And every curriculum is so different. What if I don't understand what we are doing? How will I get good grades? What are ""good grades""? How will teachers know if I don't understand vs I am slacking off? I am pretty sure that I have ADHD but my parents won't let me get tested, and mental illness runs in my family. What if I need extra help? How do I get that? Will I be able to if I don't have a diagnosis? What does "" extra help"" mean? People are going to look at me odd if I need extra help right? They'll think I am just lazy and make excuses. And that I am just getting carried through without doing any work. <newline>  <newline> I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach.

628;sxhu9o;I’ve started noticing possible symptoms of adhd in myself;I 14|f never really noticed any of these things before because I’ve been dealing with ptsd and depression for the past 3 years of my life but things have finally started to settle down and I’m noticing somethings. Before I start saying my symptoms I want to make it clear I’m not trying to self diagnose or anything it’s just I’ve had bad experiences with therapy and with therapists so I want to feel like my concerns are valid before I ask for any kind of help again. <newline>  <newline> I’ve always been an outgoing extroverted kid and I never really had any problems until middle school. I suffered a lot of abuse and was diagnosed with ptsd from it. Because I was only focusing on staying alive I didn’t have time to think about the intricacies of my feelings and actions but now I do. <newline>  <newline> I was scrolling through tiktok (as cliche as it is) and I came across this video of this lady talking about how she was diagnosed with adhd late and how when she finally was diagnosed it all my sense. I was curious about it so I went on her page and looked a few more videos and found myself heavily relating to a lot of it. Before I came across this tiktok I was already becoming super frustrated with myself because I have super big exaggerated reactions to things and I was upset for not reacting the right way in certain social situations. I’ve been having trouble focusing on class for 3 years but it got really bad over quarantine. I remember this one time my mom scolded me for not doing well in school and being upset that my grades were dropping. I went upstairs and cried and thought that I should just quit art and all my hobbies because I couldn’t do both. During that time I was learning Japanese, practicing art and animation, skateboarding, and making YouTube and I was really happy with my hobbies but my grades were dropping because I physically couldn’t pay attention in class. It also hurt because I was trying to get clean and sober and a huge part of my relapses were because of boredom so to counteract this I would pick up a new hobby to fill my time but my mom was just like I’m lazy and so many people are always calling me lazy and I’m just so confused because I feel like I do so much but it never seems to be enough. The only thing that makes anyone happy are good grades. <newline>  <newline> Math and science were especially hard and they still are now. I remember actually trying to lay attention in class and having to ask my teacher to say the exact same thing 3 times because I didn’t understand, it’s like my brain just was absorbing the information. I didn’t wanna hold the class up so I just pretended and of course my grade in math was horrible.  <newline>  <newline> Those are just some things I was remembering from my past that could be explained by adhd. Presently when I’m in class still math and science mostly when I try and focus I get like this buzzing in my head and I get a headache and I just want to lay down. I can’t sit still or focus unless the teacher is actually teaching (which is hard to home by in high school). I’ve started to really notice my forgetfulness and lack of motivation for anything and I couldn’t figure out was wrong because I’m not depressed or suicidal anymore so why am I not happy? <newline>  <newline> I’ve been doing well in school even with all of this and I have a 3.7 GPA but I haven’t had the energy for drawing, skating, YouTube, crochet, Japanese or literally anything that isn’t school related because I always have so much to do. It’s exactly like quarantine just reversed.I stared trying to keep track of my symptoms so I have something to tell my therapist or psychiatrist if I do decide to go but I’m scared they’ll say it’s noting and I’ll have gone through all that anxiety for nothing. I mean it’s not like exhibited any symptoms in my childhood that I know of so what if it’s just all in my head and they think I’m attention seeking or something. Thought makes me nauseous. I’m sorry for such a long post I just need to tell someone because I don’t wanna tell anyone in my personal life about any of this unless I’m sure somethings wrong.;Large-Fishstick;False;4;0.87;2022-02-21 02:07:58;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/sxhu9o/ive_started_noticing_possible_symptoms_of_adhd_in/;twoxadhd

631;stf9e6;My doctor wants me to decide whether I want to continue trying to treat ADHD or shift focus to treat anxiety first, and if ADHD, whether I want to try a new medication or try another dose change - I have two days to decide;Title is the TLDR. <newline>  <newline> I've been on generic Adderall IR on incremental doses for a little over a month now. I was tracking the following symptoms and I'm seeing little to no improvement. <newline>  <newline> 1. Inability to start a task - telling myself I need to do X task but not actually starting it for hours or even days.- time to take a shower, time to do laundry, time to start working on this ticket for work. I end up doing most things at the very last minute. <newline>  <newline> 2. Inability to make a decision leading to paralysis and then procrastination - what should I eat for lunch / dinner, out of my to-do list, which item should I do first? Should I go out with my friends or should I stay home and finish my giant pile of things I need to work on? <newline>  <newline> 3. Losing track of time - thinking I spent 5 minutes doing something when in reality it's been an hour. <newline>  <newline> 4. Inability to pull myself away from doing something to do something else that was more important or better use of my time. - neglecting my own needs (lunch time, bathroom break) over work, difficulty getting off my phone to take a shower or make lunch, etc. <newline>  <newline> 5. Difficulty paying attention - meetings, movies and tv shows, YouTube videos, etc. <newline>  <newline> 6. Emotional disregulation. - getting really sad or really angry about random things. <newline>  <newline> 7. Motivation - pretty certain meds don't help with this but I was tracking this in the event it becomes easier to get motivated due to seeing relief in other symptom. <newline>  <newline> My psychiatrist latched on to the difficulty making a decision bit, and asked me if that is because I'm afraid of making the wrong decision. In the context for how I was tracking that symptom, no, it was more around what is the best way to get this done today or in x amount of time, while also managing what I'm actually in the mood to do, which is nothing on the list. But in other context, it depends on the situation. I know I have anxiety based decision paralysis too, but it has more to do with major life events or medical issues. <newline>  <newline> I'm fully aware I have anxiety as well and in my mind, how much impact it has on my life depends on what's going on in my life. Any major life changing events do give me a ton of anxiety. But if nothing life changing is happening, I'm ok. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I have no idea how I can make the decision of what we should do next. Making this decision is definitely difficult due to both, ADHD and anxiety, which is funny in it's own way. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> ADHd thinking - I don't know what steps to take to assess what is impacting my life more. It seems like a very daunting task and the fact that I have to figure this out in the next two days makes me not want to do it at all and bail on my appointment. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Anxious thinking - What if I make the wrong decision? What If I decide to treat one and either the treatment takes too long or doesn't work, or I realize that the other thing is actually impacting my life more, and I made the wrong decision?  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> If we do decide to treat ADHD first, he wants me to tell him if I want to move to a higher dose or try another medication. I will likely end up doing both. Trying a higher dose because I already have the meds. Trying a diff5 med once I run out because I'm curious to see how I may react to another type of stimulant. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> We ran out of time today so I have a follow up on Friday, and he expects me to think about this in the next two days. I'm glad he's patient driven and letting me choose, but I have no idea how to choose.;feelinglikeshit09;False;9;1.0;2022-02-15 22:28:20;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/stf9e6/my_doctor_wants_me_to_decide_whether_i_want_to/;twoxadhd
632;sksr5o;I am undiagnosed but trying to get help- 20F in college- quite the journey, would love advice/thoughts;TLDR: I think I have ADHD, had bad experiences with doctors, and having trouble with self doubt.  <newline>  <newline> So I began thinking I may have ADHD about a year ago from tiktok/youtube videos that I related heavily with. It was a realization like “oh, not everybody has 20 things on their mind all the time and always feel like they have a motor running in them?” Over the months, I have made a list of things that I noticed were not usually neurotypical. I first saw it in school, but looking back, a big red flag was when my manager had to specifically make me a checklist because I would forget simple tasks often.  <newline>  <newline> It seems the more research I do, the more convinced I am that I have ADHD. But there’s also A LOT of self doubt, like “do I really struggle with this? Doesn’t everybody? I’m not special, I don’t have ADHD I’m just lazy, forgetful, careless, etc.” my own brain tells me “you just want to have ADHD because it’s an excuse and you’ll get attention for it”. it’s really taken a toll on my mental health, on top of the anxiety that was already there. (I’ve figured I have gotten anxiety in my college years to compensate for executive dysfunction)  <newline>  <newline> Anyways, I had enough of this and decided I wanted to get tested. Unfortunately, mental health services are very backed up in my area, not to mention a lack of options, so when I got an appointment in December, 3 months from when I made the appointment, I was pretty content. As the days lead up to it, I was a ball of excitement and nerves. I had woken up to my alarm at 7:30 in the morning and (thought I) hit snooze. I wake up again and it’s 9:15, 15 mins after my appointment was supposed to start. I immediately called but got turned down, saying it was already too late.  <newline>  <newline> I then look to another source which had me get a referral from my primary care provider to even make an appt with the psychiatrist. I go to this appointment and read the doctor my list of reasons why I want to be tested by a psychiatrist. After I read my list, he asked maybe 3-4 questions, and basically said “yup, looks like you have ADD, I’m gonna go ahead and put you on a small dose of 15mg adderall XR” I started crying in his office, partially from finally being validated, scared of adderall, and truly wanting to be tested to know for sure. He said he was going to start treating me because it seemed obvious and it would take months to get me in to see a psychiatrist. I was taking Zoloft at the time, so he told me, go ahead and stop Zoloft and you can start adderall today!  <newline>  <newline> I was excited, the first couple days I did not feel much, but over the two weeks that I took adderall, I became an emotional wreck. I would cry almost every day, become super irritable for no or small reason, and I feel bad for my bf bc I had a hard time living with myself. the negatives were so intense that I could not notice any improvement in focus or executive function. I had an appointment with the doctor for the next month, but I had to get in sooner. I had also found out that the doctor never even made the referral to the psychiatrist, which is the whole reason I went in.  <newline>  <newline> I was able to get in 15 days after I first took adderall. This time, my mom was there with me. She wanted to be there for support and just get another set of ears in the room. She did not say much, but her presence completely changed the way the doctor acted. He was asking more questions, explaining things more so that he would sound more knowledgeable, and basically mansplaining things that I had known through my research. He asked my to read my list again, but this time, he said “you know, I think the ADHD is secondary and the anxiety and depression are primary so we’ll just put you back on Zoloft.” I was livid, when I asked why he had a different opinion this time, he said “sometimes it takes multiple consultations to get the full picture” so why did you diagnose me and prescribe me a controlled substance within 15 minutes of meeting me at the last appointment? He also went on a tangent saying ADHD can only be caught before the 7th/8th grade and there is no test for adults. Which are both totally false. I even asked for alternative Medication, but he could not name one. It was a very frustrating situation but I’m back where I was before all this, on my Zoloft and okay with it.  <newline>  <newline> I am sad I had such a bad experience with getting help and it’s really not helping my self doubt. I feel confused and frustrated, but it’s better than how I felt on adderall. I know I can function okay how I am naturally, but it’s exhausting and it’s always going to be nibbling at me until I get a real test. As of right now, my soonest option to get in with a psychiatrist is June, but I’m still looking. This probably comes off as a bit of a rant but I’m honestly just looking for support and advice… <newline>  <newline> Hope all is well, thank you for reading:);__whoop__;False;1;0.86;2022-02-05 00:11:45;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/sksr5o/i_am_undiagnosed_but_trying_to_get_help_20f_in/;twoxadhd

636;s21u1m;ADHD loneliness as an adult;"I dunno what I'm hoping for with this post.I just don't have anyone or anywhere else to share with. I'm not really looking for advice, more just wanting to get this out. Sorry it got a little long. <newline>  <newline> I got diagnosed last year in my mid 30's and am stable on meds which is lovely.Its been uplifting to know that all my struggles aren't because I am a crappy person but mostly due to brain structure/chemistry which can be handled better. <newline>  <newline> On the surface I have a good life.I have been with my husband for 16 years, we are the best friends and deeply in love despite life's ups and downs. I have 2 healthy children (2&4) who are just the best little people. We own our house and my husband has a good secure job that means the pandemic has been mostly manageable. <newline>  <newline> However a lifetime of rampant undiagnosed ADHD has taken it's toll. In a standard ADHD impulsive choice, I quit my good career that I love last year to be a SAHM. Childcare meant I was not really earning anything so it seemed pointless. I was a Software Engineer but struggled with imposter syndrome as one of only a few women and the only developer who was a married mum. Coupled with tech interviews being the worst, my confidence at returning to this career is disappearing daily. <newline>  <newline> I have no friends. At all. I have people I know (mostly through husband) but not an actual friend.  <newline>  <newline> My only real social life is playing D&D alongside my husband but beyond that there isn't much. I know people on Discord who we play games with. However they are almost all guys, none have spouses or kids so they have a lot more free time and I miss most extra socialising moments.  <newline>  <newline> I did have one friend but after 5 years it's clear she has BPD and it has been very one sided in her favour. After I told her last month I didn't approve of her being involved with a married man she hasn't spoken to me. She appears to have replaced me now with someone else. <newline>  <newline> So now I have no real friends at all. I never really have. When I got married my hen party was my sister, my mum, my sister's best friend (I only knew as a kid) and my husband's old school friend. It is horrible looking at my wedding photos, the only people there for ""me"" was my mum, sister, her friend and my nan. That's it.  <newline>  <newline> My entire life is now just looking after my kids all day every day. My husband does his part after work, so no complaints there. I have some free time for an hour or two in evening but it's limited and we don't really have money for me to do much with it. <newline>  <newline> I've spoken to my husband and he is very supportive but there is nothing he can really do to help. He has suggested for me to have a weekend away for a break (as he has one soon with his friends of 30 years) which is lovely and appreciated. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I have nobody to go with, no hobbies to do there and cos of finances it wont even be a fancy cottage etc. <newline>  <newline> Im just so lonely. I struggle to be a good friend cos ADHD. I struggle to make new friends as I have crap confidence after years of undiagnosed ADHD. My self esteem is low as I have nothing I can build it on beyond what I can give to others.  <newline>  <newline> TLDR: ADHD sucks, especially if undiagnosed cos nobody in the 90's (outside the US at least) thought girls had it. <newline>  <newline> Thank you if you read this, I just wanted to put something down to people who may understand.";BmbleBTuna22;False;35;1.0;2022-01-12 09:01:30;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/s21u1m/adhd_loneliness_as_an_adult/;twoxadhd

Not because I’m particularly lazy—I’m happy biking around and doing weightlifting—but because it is SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I used to get absolutely insane lower back/hip/leg pain that was basically undiagnosable (“you don’t have any nerve or disc issues, you just have a weak core” uhhhh ok, then how come I can deadlift 175 pounds no problem). Sometimes I couldn’t walk to the end of the block without starting to cry from pain. It got significantly, but not completely, better when I started taking Wellbutrin and then Vyvanse in 2020.  <newline>  <newline> But even now, I have to essentially hyperfocus on squeezing my transverse abdominus at all times, forcing my pelvis into a neutral, non-anterior-tilted position, keeping my upper trunk up without bending it backwards too much, and taking every step so I’m using my hamstrings and not clamping down on my quads and landing on my heel and not the ball/toes/outside ridge of my foot.

639;rg8vm3;Does anyone have any tricks for waiting mode?;I'm struggling so much with waiting mode recently, I'm having a few minor health issues and having lots of drs appointments/hospital visits and I'm also online tutoring which means sessions at random times of the day and lots of gaps between.  <newline>  <newline> I really hate waiting mode. For example, I've had a tutoring gap between 11-3pm today, and all I've been able to do is watch youtube and browse reddit whilst checking the clock every 10 minutes. I also know as soon as the session is over I won't be able to relax this evening because I have to go to the hospital in the morning and I'll be in waiting mode for that.  <newline>  <newline> It really stops me to enjoy my free time. The thing I hate is that I dread everything so much but once I'm there and I'm doing it, I don't mind at all, I feel like I don't trust myself to remember or something, but even though I dread things, once I'm doing it, I tend to enjoy it, so it's frustrating how much I dread things \*sigh\*  <newline>  <newline> Why do we do this, is it a case of never feeling mentally prepared? <newline>  <newline> Has anyone found a way around this?

641;qv1r6q;I just need to vent a little…;So, a few months ago, I had told my ex (who has custody, not legally… yet, of my older two kids) that I was going to try and get medicated for my ADHD. Not too long after my doctor appointment, I get paperwork in the mail for custody of the kids. I had such a hard time focusing on the paperwork because of the meds making my time blindness worse. I finally filed it all last Friday, served him via email, and did it all before the end of the deadline. <newline>  <newline> So today, I hear from a friend who follows him on Facebook that he’s gloating saying he got custody of the kids and that I didn’t even file anything. I am extremely frustrated with him, but I know I can’t express it to him because he’s just going to claim harassment. <newline>  <newline> My daughter that he has behaves almost identically to myself when I was her age, she’s five, and I’m fairly positive she has ADHD like I do. I’ve asked and begged him to seek a diagnosis for both of the kids, but he tells me that the principal of the school they attend advised him not to until they are ten. As if they can diagnose ADHD and won’t even give out recommendations unless they disturb the class. <newline>  <newline> He also complains that the education in the state of Utah is so much better quality than what I could possibly find in Alaska, but he’s got them enrolled in a school that is worse than both of the elementary’s near me and is one of the worst one’s ranked in the city he lives in. <newline>  <newline> On top of all that, he’s asking the court to award him nearly $1200, which is nearly 1/3 of my total income, more than my total income after taxes. He’s made numerous attempts to make me pay him absolutely ridiculous amounts of money, especially when things start going well for me emotionally.;RedVamp2020;False;7;0.88;2021-11-16 06:48:45;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/qv1r6q/i_just_need_to_vent_a_little/;twoxadhd
642;qgdx8d;I don’t experience some of the core ADHD symptoms?;Tldr: I don’t identify with multiple tabs, bees in your head, object permanence or racing thoughts. I know everyone has different symptoms but these seem like core ADHD for most people. <newline>  <newline> I was diagnosed last year and while I 80% identify with most ADHD posts I see on here, there are some symptoms that everyone seems to experience and I never have.  <newline> I see almost everyone say that they have multiple tabs open in their head. Maybe I’m misunderstanding it, but I don’t relate to that. I do have where it’s like “oh I should pick my clothes up off the floor” and instead start scrolling tiktok and then after a few minutes, I’m like “oh I need to go do my makeup” and never do the clothes, but it’s rarely like several thoughts in my head at once.  <newline>  <newline> I also don’t have racing thoughts. I do when I’m excited or talking to someone, but when I’m home alone and just relaxing, I typically don’t.  <newline>  <newline> And I don’t understand the thing I’ve seen about bees in your head. My head is fairly quiet except I’ve realized that without my medicine, I will ALWAYS have a song in my head. But I don’t have multiple thoughts overlaying each other or excessive noise. I never have trouble going to sleep because of too many thoughts.  <newline>  <newline> I also don’t really identify with the object permanence. I will forget about something I don’t use a lot of it gets put away, but if it’s something I use all the time, I don’t just forget it’s in my drawer.  <newline>  <newline> I do have a family history, with my aunt, cousin and brother having it. I think I’ve always doubted my diagnosis (even though I went seeking an ADHD diagnosis) because the psychologist kept comparing my symptoms to her daughter’s and was reading word for word from a book and told me ADHD doesn’t cause emotional dysregulation. She just didn’t seem like she was really evaluating me. I did take the connors 3 test and it said moderate chance. <newline>  <newline> My ex said “oh yeah, you 100% have ADHD” when I told him I got diagnosed though Lol.;samanthahkj;False;8;0.93;2021-10-26 19:18:17;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/qgdx8d/i_dont_experience_some_of_the_core_adhd_symptoms/;twoxadhd
643;q9v1ur;New to Reddit so sorry if I’ve done anything wrong!!! But help needed re: ADHD+Eating Disorder/stimulant med withdrawal/induced weight gain;So I’m on Vyvanse for ADHD so obvs it’s prescribed and I do need it, I’ve also managed to gain weight on it (recovery) and it doesn’t really lessen my appetite but I keep freaking myself out because I presume at some point in the future I’ll be taken off it and I’m TERRIFIED of gaining loads of weight. There’s so many threads on reddit & quora where people have gained TONNES and I’m a healthy weight now so really can’t afford to!!! Ik it’s not even something I need to worry about rn but it still terrifies me + I’m worried the longer I’m on it the worse it’ll be?? And if that’s the case I’d rather be off it sooner (I’ve been on it a year) and ik its because of eating more off it that you gain but the intense hunger I get when off it is insane & the kind you can’t just ignore, especially after months of recovery, it’s the kind of hunger where you legit can’t function until you eat but 10 minutes later and you need to eat again it’s awful!!! Like it’s hard enough to accept recovery and my weight now as it is never mind with impending weight gain always in the back of my mind I can never be calm because every time I try to accept my body I just think “yeah but that’s on meds... in a few years you’ll be 10x bigger) and honestly rn I can’t even deal with being like a kilo bigger I’m already over my target a lil!!!!

647;p2kafx;Did you struggle making friends as a kid?;"I came across this [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM3azhiOy5E) on rejection sensitivity and a study was brought up that really caught my attention. <newline>  <newline> ""Children and adolescents with ADHD are rated lower on social preference, are less well liked, are more often rejected, are more likely to be designed 'non-friends' by their peers, and have fewer reciprocal friends.

It became easier to make friends the older I got but I still found myself feeling that way in certain settings, especially if I didn't have someone I already knew by my side. I've also had several people accuse me of having no personality or opinions of my own over the years, which definitely stemmed from the masking and people pleasing.

On top of having ADHD, my parents never taught me any life skills. My mother INSISTED on cleaning my room and doing my laundry until I went to college. I never had chores. It wasn't until my 30s that I managed to figure out how to keep a clean house for myself.  <newline>  <newline> So here's where I'm at: I love my home and I'm super proud of it.

At any given point, my home is 80% tidy, enough for a surprise guest to pop by and for me to not be mortified. I make my bed almost every day. I keep the kitchen counters clear and clean. The dishes get done and put away. I'm very proud of my progress in being tidy. <newline>  <newline> HOWEVER - don't dare look in any drawer, closet, storage furniture, or pantry, or under that pinterest-worthy bed. I can't manage this stuff and I need some help. It's overwhelming and I find myself spending hours decluttering and organizing.. say.. the pantry, only for it to become a total mess just a couple of weeks later.

649;okworv;Could I have ADHD?;Hi everyone,  <newline>  <newline> It never even crossed my mind that I could have ADHD until yesterday, when I saw a weirdly relatable TikTok video about it. It could as well be relatable to anyone, so I might be entirely wrong, but thought you all could probably have an opinion about it. <newline>  <newline> I’ve never even considered it, because I don’t really have a bunch of energy - but then I read that this is typical for women with ADHD. <newline>  <newline> I have always been extremely messy, no matter how hard I try. Everyday seems like a battle with the mess, and it’s hard for me to do anything between a little bit and everything when I start cleaning. Even when my apartment looks nice, I feel like it’s messy if one part is, and it’s always lurking in the corner of my mind. <newline>  <newline> Most nights, I have to google at least one weird fact before being able to sleep - because questions like “do these two words have a common etymological root” or “what is the smallest rodent in the world” drive me crazy. Also get a bunch of weird sentences in my head and an urge to say them out loud when trying to sleep, like rhymes or just interresting words (lol) <newline>  <newline> If my energy is high, I sing all the time, like a crazy radio with every single song i’ve ever heard on shuffle <newline>  <newline> I cannot sit in the same position for more than a few minutes unless I an extremely focused <newline>  <newline> Small tasks seem like a biiig weight on me if I don’t wanna do them - like sending an invoice or picking up something from the floor if I don’t know exactly where it belongs. Sometimes things like brushing my teeth seems like a horrible burden. Haha. <newline>  <newline> Did well in school, but could NOT focus without doodling or writing down absolutely everything. Also, couldn’t help decorating my notes waay to nicely <newline>  <newline> I am bad at sketching / doing rough drafts - I want to fix everything immediately <newline>  <newline> Really bad at memorizing numbers while I write them down, like codes or something - can’t do more than maybe two numbers at the time. Generally feel like there isn’t a lot of space in my working memory. <newline>  <newline> I get extremely focused on my work as an artist, and can work on one thing for 10 hours straight, but I have to listen to audiobooks or else I get up to fix something or get a snack every ten minutes or so and can’t find my focus.  <newline>  <newline> I sometimes talk a lot and can’t stop myself, and must focus really hard to not interrupt or finish other peoples sentences. Other times I am really quiet. Also sometimes feel like I’m suddenly bragging even though I didn’t want to <newline>  <newline> Walking behind a slow walker drives me nuts immediately <newline>  <newline> I hate noisy spaces, like loud restaurants, and need to sit with my back to a wall to feel calm  <newline>  <newline> I can’t read a book if I can hear someone talk, because I hear every single word no matter how hard I try. <newline>  <newline> I have to focus really hard when reading books, or else my mind wanders  <newline>  <newline> If I have something I need to do at a certain time, like if I’m getting delivery, it feels like it is burned into my mind and I have to set a bunch of alarms <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Never really thought of any of these things as related, but maybe they are? <newline>  <newline> Please tell me what you think, and ask me any relevant question you can think of!

650;o9t5fc;Anger towards mental health professionals?;"Does anybody have resentment or anger towards mental health professionals about misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis? <newline>  <newline> As I am working to come to terms with my ADHD, as many of you guys all know, one the biggest issues is self-esteem and letting go of the mindset that you were the problem and that it was not your ADHD. Before diagnosis it was like a constant diatribe of looking back and cringing about all those uncomfortable moments: blowing through deadlines, being screamed at by parents, disappointed bosses, and the constant feeling that you're life wasn't quite together. I just remember I would see peers with gorgeous planners, neat backpacks, immaculate academic reputations, tidy manicures and wonder why I was so fat, frumpy, sloppy, gross, and doing everything last minute! <newline>  <newline> Now that the fog of self-hatred is slowly being lifted, I have to finally confront the fact that I did everything to help myself in the past few years. It's like I haven had any recollection about how much I tried until recently. *Thank you Adderall for clearing my muddied thoughts!* <newline>  <newline> Senior year of high school when my life started falling apart, a concerned teacher dragged me to counseling. And though I was embarrassed,I embraced it and talked it out. The counselor was cool, but it was the classic you're the super articulate high achieving girl, nothing is really wrong with you. You're lined up to go to a fancy college and you're probably just burned out. <newline>  <newline> Then in college when first semester I couldn't get it together, I went to mental health services. I was mortified by now. Saw an amazing counselor, then she referred me to a psychiatrist just to be safe. Went to him, he evaluated me for anxiety and depression, quickly anxiety ruled out because I don't have it. *Um, why isn't there and ADHD work up alongside depression screenings?* Then we sort of agreed I wasn't depressed and sent me off. Continued with the counselor which was good but then you know with these overburdened services, once they help they want you out. Went to a physician, I did discover I had anemia and vitamin D deficiency which certainly made things much worse. Also doctors have been almost useless to me in my 24 years of living for basic things like anemia! <newline>  <newline> Then I spent freshman, sophomore and junior year trying to the separate academic counseling service. It's hard to explain this but it's more study strategies than counseling but most people working there have backgrounds social workers (LICSW) or education. Talked with a three of four people, got some help in ""thinking about my issues,"" but again NO person even suggested that my academic struggles could be ADHD and I have SEVERE, and classic PI ADHD and have had it all my life. I just didn't know that PI ADHD existed. I literally diagnosed myself from a random youtube video within 3 minutes of her mentioning ADHD. <newline>  <newline> Even joined a mental health advocacy group on campus because I wanted to help with mental health stigma. <newline>  <newline> Shit show continues, and senior year I go back to the mental health services. Saw a counselor who has good intentions but wasn't a good fit for me. But still nothing, just you sorta maybe kind of maybe depressed but since you're a headstrong upbeat person probably not. Basically crawled on my hands and knees to get my degree. <newline>  <newline> Like I tried y'all, and it wasn't fucking enough.";a_dream_deferred;False;44;1.0;2021-06-28 20:51:20;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/o9t5fc/anger_towards_mental_health_professionals/;twoxadhd

I hope it's helpful to some.  And also, of course, I'm not sponsored - just an excited girl sharing her discoveries - that make life easier, less messy and feeling more put together. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **For hair** \- this works for ear/jaw length to the end of your body (if that's your jam) and I think I'll mostly work for wavy to straight hair that is unruly. **The Babyliss Rotation Hot Air Brush** \- it's a game-changer! It'll blowdry your hair while giving it the salon effect. I always look like a crazy pigeon lady day in and out but that brush is a heaven's gift and I recommend it from the bottom of my heart. Honestly - if you don't want to spend long hours learning how to style or struggle to put in the time to style your hair - just do this after washing it. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **The nails:** ok, so I got the first product from a beauty box and was really taken aback at the **speed it dried**. I love painting my nails but they're *always* smudged - who's with me? Who the hell can sit down long enough without touching anything?? Not me. Ok, I guess there are several brands that dry really fast but this is my first attempt and I. AM. IN. LOVE. So I went online and got some more and they all dry fast - **the Brand is called** [**EMITÉ MAKEUP**](https://www.emitecosmetics.com/category/nails-2) **.** They don't have a lot of different colours - I bought HONE, DAHL and COLE and they're gorgeous. ADHD seal of recommendation with a kiss. And they're **vegan and cruelty-free**\- I can't imagine more wins in one. Honestly - hands down - the best. The brush is a normal size too and the varnish is really good quality so 1 coat is enough. from opening the bottle to be able to put on makeup without a major accident was around 3-5minutes. <newline>    * [u/deartabby](https://www.reddit.com/u/deartabby/) recommends: The S**ally Hansen 30 second INSTA-DR**I nail polish is my lifesaver. Also, get yourself a topcoat that’s combined with the quick-dry liquid. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Mani-Care: Have your mani set on your desk-** so you can do your mani/handcare while on a call. In my box, I have **nail oil (so I really do it every day), hand cream (several times a day and my hands are like YAAAY), 1-2 of the quick-dry varnish, nail buffer and a nail file**.  I use a nice looking glass container for my stuff - so that I actually see it. And **seeing it is vital** \- because when is it I'm definitely looking at my hands? While in a call. And then I think - damn I gotta get my nails fixed. But then I get up and the world calls for more distractions so they never get fixed. If you don't have a desk job get a little bag for your bag and put these items there - you know you have it on hand when you see your hands. ha - pun unintended. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Skin Care -** I love skincare. It's my nighttime ritual and gives me a sense of accomplishment. BUT - sometimes I don't have the energy to do a whole routine - and you're probably feeling me here. If you don't have the energy for a whole routine but still want to take care of yourself get yourself 3 post-its (or whatever like three sheets of paper or a whiteboard and 3 sections - you get my drift) - because you're going to make 3 routines. I've called them low energy/high energy but after thinking about it for a while maybe it's less offputting to call them just basic, medium, full (or anything like that) so that it doesn't put you down when you already had a shitty day. <newline> * **You'll make 3 routines depending on your day and capacity** <newline>    * **Low Energy Nighttime** <newline>       * Wash face with water, remove makeup with Make-up wipes (I know you shouldn't use them daily, but we're talking here exceptionally bad days) <newline>       * u/thehungerwasntwrong suggests [https://makeuperaser.com/](https://makeuperaser.com/) for removing makeup. only needs water. <newline>       * get a night mask like ""la neige water sleeping mask"" or ""Vichy hyalu mask"" (this one I'm currently using) - good to go for some zzz and your skin isn't hating you. The reason why I recommend a night mask is because it contains more of the ingredients you want on your skin without going through a whole routine - while also being a moisturizer. Of course, a simple moisturizer suffices, but I got the masks for days where I can't be bothered to do a 3-7 steps routine. <newline>    * **Medium Energy Nighttime** <newline>       * Wash face with water and your cleanser of choice <newline>       * serum/AHA/BHA of choice <newline>       * your Retin Product of choice <newline>       * moisturizer / oil <newline>    * **Energetic Nighttime Routine** <newline>       * all the stuff you love doing to really take care of yourself like double cleansing, masks, niacinamide, retinol, lactic acid/mandelic acid, toner ladida - I'm not a skincare expert so please do your research. <newline> * \--> **if that's all too much just get a good moisturizer** with hyaluronic and hopefully retinol for the night and use a different one for the day (bonus points if it has a minimal SPF of 20) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Body Hair:** regardless of where you stand and what your preferences are - the fact is, most of us want to get rid of some hair. <newline>    * **epilators** for non-sensitive areas. They're painful at first, but the hair removal lasts longer and I swear the hair grows back smoother and in fewer places. I think the only reason they're not recommended more is that it's not permanent. ( u/invaderpixel) <newline>    * I got a **Phillips Lumea IPL** device and I totally would recommend for adhd. I hardly have to shave at all anymore and I’ve only used the thing like 3 times ever! Honestly, life-changing. ( u/ShenmeRaver) <newline>    * In general: Laser seems to be a good option if you can afford it you should try it. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Feet -** I often forget about my feet but I started to always buy some extra foot masks and leave them in my night desk. So when I'm scrolling like a fool, reading or watching a movie I just whip the foot mask out and let my feet soak in those moist booties for however long until I feel it's enough. They're not super cheap but worth the money when you constantly forget to do your feet / getting a Pedi. Personally, I don't think of my feet unless I see them - right in front of me - being disgusting as I want to put some sandals on - so doing a little bit every now and then goes a reaaaaally long way. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Teeth: Brush them in the shower.** Have an extra set of toothpaste and toothbrush so you don't forget. It becomes a really good habit really fast - I don't shower without brushing my teeth ever. <newline>    * u/imaginury Triplebristle toothbrush.

If you have long hair that needs layers, a poor-man's haircut is an option.\*\* I have thick wavy hair that looks best in layers, but I don't always like to spend $$$ getting it cut. Plus that would involve making an appointment, remembering it, showing up on time, etc. <newline>    * [This video is pretty good explaining it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-GAilMmCqQ), but for convenience <newline>       * After showering, bend over and flip hair over your head. <newline>       * Brush as straight as possible (mine's wavy so it'll only get so straight\*) <newline>       * Take the bottom 1-2 inches between your fingers (she puts it in a hair tie, but I never do LOL) <newline>       * Cut bluntly straight across. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **Eyebrows** <newline>    * Little eyebrow shavers are my best friend because it takes no time to swoop a razor across your skin. They're small so the precision is good. <newline>    * Get them dyed in a store - it costs like 15 dollars to get them died and you'll have pretty eyebrows for a like a month. <newline>    * Buy ""Just for Men"" beard dye and use it on your eyebrows, only takes about 5 minutes and darkens my eyebrows. I use it every week/every other week ( u/vainner65) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> * **House: do your bed right after waking up.**  this is not a beauty hack per se but a cosmetic house hack  - this way you do something really nice for your bedtime-self and your room will look a lot tidier with low effort. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I really hope this helps someone - and also please share your hacks!! and FYI: I'm 33F and white/Latina.

653;njcxol;So overwhelmed when reading all these symptoms I've had.;"Hi all, I'm new to this community and have been waiting for over a month to see a psych which has thankfully been booked for early June. Sorry for the length of this in advance, but I'm just overwhelmed. <newline>  <newline> My (24F) ADHD journey started randomly. About two months ago I was watching a random Youtube video about some girl getting a cleaner and explaining why to people who criticize her. She described being extremely messy and in passing mentioned ADHD and OCD, of which I believe the former. It wasn't just being messy, but the way she described it, that hit me. Like the disorganization always being there and threatening to explode out of you. And that I've never outgrown it. Three minutes into the video, I literally stopped it and started researching. This was what I was experiencing all my life. I just started to research random things like ""ADHD + grammar"" and couldn't believe it. I had never even come close to thinking I had ADHD except for freshman year of college when the shit starting hitting the fan. I considered it but I brushed it off since I never had issues sitting in class and I could read for hours.  <newline>  <newline> I don't even really have the words or the concepts to express this, but is/was anybody so overwhelmed by ADHD symptoms and learning you've been experiencing them all your life, but thinking you were normal? It's like anger, disbelieve, shame, excitement, incredulity all at once? And it's just every time I try to sit down a learn a bit more, I just get overwhelmed with how much this has disrupted my life that I can't continue reading.  <newline>  <newline> I'm two years past a horrible time at college and literally living at home loathing myself with no idea what I want to do next. <newline>  <newline> To keep this short, some of the things I've experienced. <newline>  <newline> * Disorganization throughout my entire life. Spanked, beaten, grounded punished for things. Called a pig. Parents mad that I didn't notice something out of place and just walked over it. Parents disposing of my items without my consent because I was hoarding.  <newline>  <newline> * Never hand or fold clothes or bed. My room literally always has clothes all over the floor. I read the organization posts here and was just flabbergasted about how I fit this to a T. <newline>  <newline> * Being harassed and bullied a teacher due to careless mistakes. Other teachers kindly telling me I was having issues with tenses and stuff, but I had no idea how to correct it. Like I got it, but couldn't change my ways. Literally still scared of writing emails to this day because I can't catch the errors.  <newline>  <newline> * Taking standardized testing (ACT) with no prep. Getting a 99% percentile score with no prep in reading, literally getting the worst score in English which is grammar and sentence structure (like a 10 point difference if you are familiar with ACT). Realized I had never really grasped grammar despite doing well in school and being gifted. Now in my 20s, I also realize I need to revisit grammar again! <newline>  <newline> * Never really felt grooming was a part of me. It always felt separate. Struggled with brushing teeth regularly, showers, weight, keeping up appearances. No strong interest in clothing. I'm not a total slob, but it just feels, idk so estranged to do those things routinely. Teeth are starting to fall apart. <newline>  <newline> * Huge weight gain and fluctuations. Binge eating. Need to lose over 100 lbs. I also have PCOS so if anybody has any tips it would be great. <newline>  <newline> * Erratic driving. Family complains about my driving and says ""I drive like a man."" Spent a lot of time driving and speeding because I loved it. Have no where to go and not in a rush but will be driving 80 mph down the highway. <newline>  <newline> * **Pacing terribly. Pacing, instead of working. Pacing in basement or garage while listening to music. I realized this out of everything is probably the most odd to people. Pacing for hours back and forth.**  <newline>  <newline> * Terrible procrastination of course, have blown straight through deadlines with no excuse. Have no explanations. Struggling to get started or to stay focused. <newline>  <newline> * Struggling with directions. Realized I had no innate problem with them, but I am constantly daydreaming and don't pay attention to the road. Once I start driving I almost immediately go on autopilot and can't turn it off. I live in a small town and when I started to drive couldn't go basic places without GPS. <newline>  <newline> * Strong aversion to film and TV. Haven't watched a TV show in a decade. Will only go watch a film is a friend asks. Literally leaves the room if a family member turns of the TV. <newline>  <newline> * Constantly losing things. Using find my iPhone sometimes several times a day. Have lost license twice in a year, credit card, debit card.  <newline>  <newline> * Purse is always a mess. Isn't it normal for most people's rooms to get a bit messy? But even my little pocket book was always junky. Once I pay for something I have never really managed to put my card, cash, or receipt back. I just get anxious and jam in into my back. Backpack a mess in school. Would never get my papers into my folders but should just shove them in. Teachers calling me out for being disorganized. <newline>  <newline> * When studying in college I would constantly go in and out of the library several times in a night. Or with friends I would get up to go take a lap round the block! Friends constantly asking me where I was going. <newline>  <newline> * Periods of impulse buying. Would get hooked on something and move on. Clothes, then shoes, then makeup, then skincare, then couponing.  <newline>  <newline> * Gifted student who then went on to crash in college. Failed a course, took time off, and now here I am 2 years behind my cohort spending these last two years mostly hating myself and grieving the college experience I never had. <newline>  <newline> * Constantly feeling my mind was going faster than my mouth would go. Would occasional get tripped over words when talking.  <newline>  <newline> And through all of this I, and other just thought I was normal? I still can't get how I won so many award, scholarships, got into several Ivy League schools, and made some semblance of a high achieving life when I was this fucked up. <newline>  <newline> I've been reading this sub when I can manage it, and it's true, I am going through this horrible grief space where I can't make sense of how I had all of this going on. <newline>  <newline> TLDR: I am a weird person. Please excuse all these grammar issues.";a_dream_deferred;False;11;1.0;2021-05-23 17:48:08;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/njcxol/so_overwhelmed_when_reading_all_these_symptoms/;twoxadhd
654;nj6uxs;How to be an advocate for yourself?;Hi friends! I could do with some advice  <newline>  <newline> TLDR: (although I’ll be eternally grateful for anyone who does read the below) newly diagnosed ADHD (March) still unmedicated and not going to make deadline for my career (a review of all my work so far against a set of requirements, which I’m not going to achieve). Need to advocate for myself and how this is all effecting me but struggling with how to do that without over sharing or sound like I’m making excuses.  <newline>  <newline> So I’m coming up against a deadline on Wednesday that I’m not going to meet. It’s a big one where a panel sit down and look at my portfolio of assessments and evidence for the year and decide if I can move on to the next stage of training. These happen every year and unfortunately last years was also a bit shaky due to the fact I’d had 7 weeks off I’ll due to depression (which I can now see clear as day was due to my struggles with my ADHD symptoms and all of this portfolio paperwork). Even so I managed to get back to works and pull it all together and get all the required assessments before the final deadline. <newline>  <newline> I was diagnosed in March and won’t start medication until June. And other than that I’ve not had any input from the psychiatry team, I’ll admit I feel a little abandoned, although YouTube and Reddit have been pretty life saving resources. I feel that the process of coming to terms with this diagnosis, while working in ICU through the pandemic, has meant that I’ve only just started to recognise the patterns of ADHD behaviour in my life, and quite how significantly they have been effecting me. Also learning how my coping mechanisms of only getting things done through pretty brutal self hatred and anger aren’t actually normal and how destructive they have been to my overall mental health, although they are all I’ve known/had at my disposal! So I’ve started trying to put some ADHD friendly support systems and coping mechanisms in place, but I’m still struggling. It’s hard to do while also getting together all of these assessments and reflections and course certificates, while also doing my day to day ICU job while also studying for my exams....  <newline>  <newline> I need to find away to explain what’s going on to a group of people who (despite being doctors themselves) likely have little understanding of adult ADHD and it’s symptoms, explain what I need (although I’m not entirely sure the options myself) and get across that I really have been trying (eg spending days at the library on my days off but still getting next to nothing done) without it sounding like I’m being lazy or making excuses, or completely over sharing and trying to turn it into a therapy session.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> If you’ve got this far I’m honestly so grateful.  <newline>  <newline> Has anyone else had to find a way to advocate for their needs etc at work in the setting of appearing to fall behind. Any advice at all would be amazing, but I also just wanted to take this opportunity to say thanks to this subreddit, you lot have been so helpful and a great source of information over the last few months.;electricholo;False;2;0.88;2021-05-23 12:33:27;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/nj6uxs/how_to_be_an_advocate_for_yourself/;twoxadhd

656;mxhkqo;ADHD and sleep - let’s be real, what works for you?;Hi all! I (32f) have been a terrible sleeper all my life and before my diagnosis, it was just something I had accepted as a fact. Now that I’m diagnosed and realize that my *chronic insomnia* is an ADHD symptom I feel like maybe I can find a solution. I guess I never really understood the severity of my issues until I read the ridiculous criteria of chronic insomnia - I had the same feeling as when I read about ADHD symptoms - ‘Wait - isn’t this normal..?’  <newline>  <newline> So. I’ve been trying to find *realistic* and ADHD-friendly solutions. I am a corona-student doing my MA thesis so I have no obligations to wake up at a certain time, so I figured this is a good time to experiment properly. I went on YouTube to find some videos on ADHD and sleep but all the advice I found were just these annoying and obvious ‘neurotypical’ advice that I’ve of course tried like ‘put your phone away’ and ‘go to bed at the same time’ and ‘take a brain dump before going to bed’ (lol seriously- how can anyone who gives advice on ADHD think this is a realistic advice??)  <newline>  <newline> Since I don’t have anything I have to get up for, I have been allowing myself to sleep in so I at least (or nearly) get 4 hours at night the last few weeks. Before meds, I could easily do a full day on 1-2 hours of sleep, but I have noticed that my meds don’t work well if I get less than 4-5 hours. So for a while I was trying to get up at 08 every day, but when I fall asleep at 07 and only got 3 hours of sleep the day before and I have shit to do - I allow myself to sleep until 11.  <newline>  <newline> The other day I video chatted with a friend and by 10 pm she was so visibly tired that she was almost falling asleep and I was SO jealous! I’m so energetic at night and it just looked amazing to be super tired at 10. So - my goal: being able to sleep before midnight (or at least before 03) and get at least 6 (preferably 7) hours a sleep every night and wake up by myself at around 6-7.  <newline>  <newline> So far this is what I’ve been trying:  <newline>  <newline> - I’ve used melatonin for months, that kinda worked in the beginning <newline>  <newline> - when I started on Ritalin a few months ago I finally slept well for the first 3-4 weeks, and then it stopped ‘working’.  <newline>  <newline> - being outside in daylight for at least an hour before noon  <newline>  <newline> - exercising (running outside) at least 30 minutes everyday. I am still doing this and it helps.  <newline>  <newline> - *not using phone or tv the last 2-3 hours before bed*. This I’ve tried a million times and it just doesn’t work for me, it just drives my head into hypermode and either my fantasy and imagination, or my anxiety just runs wild.  <newline>  <newline> - ofc podcasts, music, sleep meditations, audiobooks and poetry in various languages to try to get my super active brain tentacles to latch onto them  <newline>  <newline> - reading a book until I fall asleep: this can work for me when I’ve been physically active and social all day and have a good rhythm. For my understimulated corona-student life, it sadly doesn’t do the trick.  <newline>  <newline> - moving my tv into the bedroom and watching series/movies until I fall asleep. I just started this a week ago and it kinda worked the first 2-3 nights. It made me fall asleep within a few hours (before 01!), and it has the added bonus of keeping my head distracted so I don’t have to deal with my overthinking. The first three nights of this I even got my first three nights of deep sleep of more than 2 hrs instead of my usual 30-80 minutes. I feel kinda guilty about this one and tried removing it again to see if my exercise made it possible for me to fall asleep without the TV. It didn’t, so last night after being wide awake until 04, I ‘gave in’ and pulled out my iPad, put on a video and feel asleep within 20 minutes. So I think this is one of my ‘ADHD-sleep hacks’ - fuck the ‘shame’ of watching TV in bed, if it works it works, done.  <newline>  <newline> - *getting up at the same time every morning* - this has just lead to me getting 3-4 hours of sleep around 3 days in a row. Then I have one night of 8 or 9 hours zombie sleep, and then I’m back to 3-4 hours.  <newline>  <newline> Someone told me that they have been getting up super early like 04-05 in the morning. I think this is something that could maybe work, or at least getting up at 06 everyday. I’m considering pulling an all-nighter tonight so that I can maybe fall asleep before 01 the next night. Does anyone else pull all-nighters to ‘reset’? That’s another one of those things I feel like I ‘shouldn’t’ do - but maybe it works?  <newline>  <newline> So my question: what are your ADHD sleep hacks? I really feel like the ‘normal’ advice just makes the situation worse for me, so I would love some ideas and to hear what works for other ADHDers! I’m desperate and open to try anything! <newline>  <newline> Edit to add: I am 5 minutes into this video https://youtu.be/SkuIL-Ljmwo and I’m already super excited to finally find something that addresses this problem and describes what I experience. She shows a statistic showing that 94% of the combined type clients they worked with struggled with Sleep Onset Insomnia (yay- now I finally know what it’s called!) whereas only 6% of their inattentive ADHD clients;macfireball;False;19;0.95;2021-04-24 10:49:59;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/mxhkqo/adhd_and_sleep_lets_be_real_what_works_for_you/;twoxadhd
657;mczgwz;Really struggling and newly diagnosed;Recently diagnosed, 28, doctor, predominately inattentive type <newline>  <newline> I am really struggling and I don’t know who to talk to... so I’m just going to write some stuff down here.  <newline>  <newline> I’m so frustrated at myself. I am so so behind with my portfolio work for my job/training and today Is my only day off this week so I came to work to try and catch up. I got here at 10:45 (despite the fact I wanted to get here at nine but I got distracted watching Antman on my phone while sitting on the sofa in my dressing gown). And despite the fact I’ve been here for 3 and a half hours the only two things I’ve achieved is opening my portfolio and making a list... THATS IT.  <newline>  <newline> Every time I try to start its like I think of a million and one other things I need to do first: like looking up a patient I looked after 2 months ago to see what he opened to them, or finding the perfect song to listen to so I can focus, or eating one of the snacks I bought so I don’t get distracted by being hungry... but now I’m eating my snack I want to enjoy it and I can’t enjoy it without also watching something while I eat, so I open YouTube and start watching a video and then suddenly it’s after two in the afternoon and the only thing I’ve achieved it to make myself feel frustrated, and guilty, and lazy, and hopeless.   <newline>  <newline> I still haven’t started medication as I’m waiting for a spot in the titration clinic, but now I just feel angry. Angry at myself for not being able to see this in myself, despite being medically trained myself (although I’m definitely not a psychiatrist), angry that no one at school or uni ever suggested this because, even though I got A’s in school and passed every medical school exam first try, the stress of scraping things together last minute to do that was destroying my mental health, angry that I now know that there is something that might help but it’s still out of reach.  <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what I’m expecting from posting this, but it feels easier to put this out into the hopefully anonymous internet than speak to my colleges or family.

660;m79a6l;In diagnostic process - a lot of feelings;"Hello! I don't know yet if I ""belong"" in this subreddit, as I have not formally gotten the diagnosis yet. But I hope it is okay to write here, still. <newline>  <newline> I have many times in my life wondered if I have ADHD. It is hard to explain why. I was always a very energetic kid, preferred to play with the boys as a child and just couldn't shut up. I was constantly talking/chattering. In class, at home etc. But even though I could have fits of rage I was generelly quite happy and social. Plus I liked to be with the adults and listen to their conversations. As I got older I had to change my behaviour a bit to get accepted with the other girls, especially as we got older/hit puberty. I have always had many friends and therefore not really struggled socially, at the same time I have always known I was a bit different. There were some things I just never seemed to ""get"", and I reacted differently to many situations. <newline>  <newline> As an adult I have mainly felt I have a much more active mind and imagination than many others. My head is working 24/7, I always do a lot of times at once - like listening to a podcast, reading, etc. I can't really ever ""get off"" work and read work e-mails, follow the work chat, and tip collegues about stuff even when I have time off. I was just recently told by my boss that the only thing it really accomplishes is to make the people working late/in the evening feel bad as they have no time to deal with whatever I am writing in about at 8 pm. I was a bit sad - and surprised - as I have mainly felt it as a way to ""help"" and also I feel like I have to show I am always ""on"". I have never really considered that other people find it annoying or tiring or don't really want to have their head turned ""on"" all the time. <newline>  <newline> My main problem has been a lack of thinking about consequences and impulse control. I can say things I know will regret, or I can get derailed by an argument or something while I am at work and not be able to move on from it at all. I can spend a lot of money or make other bad, rash decisions. On top of this I have always been very disorganized, but this is not really a problem - at work I manage it by writing everything down and keeping a strict system of notes etc. so I don't lose everything I work with. At home I constantly misplace stuff or forget what I was supposed to buy in the store or don't really notice the mess around me. But as I said this disorganization is really a minor issue, or ""quirk"". <newline>  <newline> During the pandemic I worked from home for a long time and it was completely horrible. I tried to do 150 things at once and ended up not doing much. I felt that my head could never really get a rest (normally, I can at least get a lot of my work energy out at work and do other stuff when I'm home, even though I also keep my head ""turned on"" sort of. This is a bit hard to explain) and I was completely exhausted. I need to have some structure around me and be at work where it is easier to focus on what I am supposed to do and where I can get inputs from others throughout the day. <newline>  <newline> I never struggled academically and was very interested at school, even though I talked a lot in class (without being allowed, often) etc. But the teachers always liked me because I was so active in class and interested in the subjects, and I always got good grades. <newline>  <newline> I still get irrationally angry quite often and can't really seem to calm myself down. But I manage to hide it better than when I was a child and I am still not angry for very long, usually the next day I can be happy again. I also have a lot of microaggressions - if technical things don't work or something breaks I can shout and swear and even scratch myself hard as an outlet for the anger. I have many times got very angry about things other people don't really think is a big deal, or had other excessive emotional reactions. <newline>  <newline> I just recently wrote on Twitter about how I feel I can never really turn my head ""off"" and struggle with emotional control. (I have also had some rants/outbursts on Twitter and other social media, so I felt a need to write this). I was contacted by a woman who is an acquantaince and she told me she knew exactly what I was feeling. That she had felt the same and recognized herself in me. She had ADHD, she told me. And she wondered if I had ever got checked. I told her no, but that I had thought about it. And that was the push I needed. I contacted a shrink and had my first session this Monday. Beforehand he made me fill out a lot of forms. He said he thinks I do have ADHD but there will be one more session and another diagnostic form I have to fill out. <newline>  <newline> Now I think a lot about this and have a lot of feelings. Mixed feelings. I am a bit scared to get the diagnosis and get prescribed heavy medication (although I can opt out of the medicines if I choose, although it is not recommended). I am a bit relieved to maybe have an explanation as to why I have always felt I am a bit different, like my life plays on a different but parallell note. And to feel maybe I will finally find ways to regulate more, to know when to stop myself and control my impulses, to calm down inside my head. I am scared of the stigma surrounding the diagnosis and the prejudices - both my own and other people's. And I am confused as to whether I will get diagnosed, or not. I just want to get done with it and get an answer. <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to share this, maybe some of you will recognize yourself in me, or not at all. Maybe I don't even have ADHD. If I do it will almost be a downer too as it means it WON'T be the explanation. But at the same time maybe it would be a relief.";jennydb;False;0;1.0;2021-03-17 20:04:51;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/m79a6l/in_diagnostic_process_a_lot_of_feelings/;twoxadhd
661;lmfnt9;Anyone else?;So lately I've realized that I probably have ADHD. I probably should have realized this sooner considering that a therapist I was seeing last year suggested that I could have it, but I'm just now (since the beginning of January) seeing how much the symptoms actually affect my life. Most of the symptoms I just thought were a normal part of everyday life?? <newline>  <newline> I won't be able to see my doctor until March, so until then I've been researching every possible thing about ADHD. I've watched countless videos, read so many articles, watched so many ADHD tiktoks, read studies, and lurked on ADHD subreddits to the point of obsession... And so much of it resonates with me. I've been researching non stop for like a month and I do this even when I'm supposed to be doing homework and I also forget to eat. <newline>  <newline> The thing is, I keep second-guessing myself like every other day thinking that there's no way that I could possibly have ADHD. It's probably me just being lazy, and I just need to work harder! And then the next day I go back and realize that I probably do have it because of x and y, and also because I still haven't done my homework. It's been a cycle like this ever since I started down this spiral... <newline>  <newline> Has anyone else experienced this back and forth with yourself before getting a diagnosis? I just wish I could see a psychiatrist sooner than later to have it be confirmed or not so that I can stop having this battle with my brain!;museidk;False;3;1.0;2021-02-18 06:18:42;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/lmfnt9/anyone_else/;twoxadhd
662;llt3a2;My referral for ADHD assessment is finally sent! I'm so excited.;It sounds so silly, but I am so excited to FINALLY get an assessment in the works. I am convinced I have ADHD, god knows I've done enough obsessive online research to find out everything I can about the condition.  <newline>  <newline> I went to my GP in October last year and was referred on the NHS. However with everything going on her in the UK I was gonna be waiting a VERY long time. <newline>  <newline> Last Tuesday I saw a TikTok where another woman in England explained about using Right To Chose to get an ADHD assessment and medication privately via the NHS. I've spent the last week discussing and showing my GP the rules etc around this and yesterday they agreed to refer me. I got a call this morning from my GP's secretary to confirm my referral has been sent today to Psychiatry UK. <newline>  <newline> After 34 years I might finally know why I am always so overwhelmed by life. That I'm not a bad wife and mum. I'm not a careless, lazy, impulsive, hot headed fool - I just have a medical condition. God I cannot wait to finally let go of this guilt and shame for all the things I've failed to do.  <newline>  <newline> Just wanted to share with women who will get it.;PurplePixi86;False;22;1.0;2021-02-17 12:09:06;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/llt3a2/my_referral_for_adhd_assessment_is_finally_sent/;twoxadhd
663;lkoc8s;I ran out of Vyvanse for 3 days and didn't realize how much it was helping my whole ass life;Tbh I am on the 3rd day of being out of Vyvanse today. I didn't get to the pharmacists on time and they are closed 1 day a week and there is a holiday. <newline>  <newline> On top of it I ALSO have my period so I am a mess hahahaha. <newline>  <newline> Like, I've been taking Vyvanse for a couple months with almost no med break so I didn't realize that my life actually got easier and I haven't been relying on some of my older ADHD coping strategies to...make my life work anymore. <newline>  <newline> Example? <newline> Making meals / meal planning <newline>  <newline> BEFORE: <newline> In order to feed myself *properly* through.the week I'd basically force myself to create an interest in cooking like twice a month. Like make a board on Pinterest, google stuff, find some recipes that sounded SUPER COOL so then I finally would have genuine stimulation+excitement to try out these recipes!! And plan which day of the week I could cook 2 diff larger batch recipes on, so then I know I needed to keep the kitchen cleaner the day before so I didn't wake up to dishes and stuff and get derailed off cooking. <newline>  <newline> NOW on Vyvanse: <newline> I can just....think about what's in my fridge and what would make a balanced meal and go prepare that. Are there dishes on the counter? Ok that's fine I can either do a few of them so I have space to chop stuff up, and clean while I cook..and also clean some more dishes in a couple hours and wipe down the counters. Easy. <newline>  <newline> Actual now ran out of Vyvanse and didn't remember coping mechanisms: <newline> Oh wow I should eat soon. But what do I have? But I just got groceries... But there is no main protein to cook? Well maybe if I just defrost it, oh but there is a counter full of dishes wait there are Tupperware the Tupperware closet is full what kind of vegetable would I eat which shape would I chop stuff in how do I want stuff to taste the dishes are overwhelming what was I thinking about again holy shit I have brain fog what was I thinking about I'm going to lay down and recover <newline>  <newline> WHAT;onigiri467;False;7;1.0;2021-02-15 22:00:57;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/lkoc8s/i_ran_out_of_vyvanse_for_3_days_and_didnt_realize/;twoxadhd
664;lhw1w8;Yo I'm straight up pissed. LIVID.;"So I was diagnosed about a month ago and started medication (vyvanse) 3 weeks ago. Absolute GAME CHANGER. Not just the meds, although they help tremendously even as we're still fiddling with dosage, but also all the new tools/strategies I've been able to implement into my life now that I **actually understand** what's going on. It's very bittersweet.   <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I'm 25, and I have literally spent the last decade BEGGING for relief. Not from ADHD, which I obviously didn't know I had - I've been desperately seeking relief from depression. Right around the age of 16 I started having episodes where I would be totally out of commision for weeks or even months on end. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (+ side a order of anxiety) at 17, and then re-diagnosed with it every time I met with a new practitioner. It was incredibly debilitating and treatment resistant. I tried everything. I spoke to academic advisors, counsellors, therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Countless hours of CBT, talk therapy, 7(!) different antidepressant medications at varying doses, anything they wanted me to try I would say ""*yes!*"". I was attending one of the top universities while accessing some of these, the psychiatrist I was seeing at the time was renowned for his work and research. These people were *experts* in their field, not a random GP or pediatrician. <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> At one point we noticed that the depression was actually very cyclical. I would be doing amazingly well, followed by a major depressive episode, and then really well again. What was happening was that I was becoming hyper focused on something exciting (first year of self-directed high school, first year at my dream school, new job, new project) and getting things done in spades. Once the hyper focus wore off and I started losing interest, I'd become exhausted. I couldn't keep up with the tedious grind, and I would become incredibly upset and ashamed and frustrated with myself. I never thought of these tasks as something I *couldn't* do, because of course I could, I'd done it a thousand times. I just....wasn't doing it. I would spend all day filled with anxiety and dread about not doing it, hating myself for not doing it..... but still not doing it. My lack of executive function was also attributed to the depression. At one point I was even put on medication for type 2 bipolar disorder - not a single person on this earth suspected ADHD for even a moment. Experts.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I get that it's underdiagnosed in women, especially ones that ""do well"" in school. It's totally reasonable that my parents and teachers didn't suspect ADHD, especially given the mainstream ideas of what ADHD looks like. But just....the sheer NUMBER of mental health practitioners that listened to me describe *textbook* symptoms and manifestations of ADHD for **hours** and **weeks** and **months**....the NUMBER of times they noticed me fidgeting, unable to hold still, eyes always darting around and then asked why I was feeling so anxious and did I want to try another new breathing exercise? Experts.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Despite everything, my life is in a good place. I'm successfully self-employed in a creative field, I make good money, I have good relationships. It's taken a disgusting amount of luck and a number of less-than-healthy coping mechanisms. But if I'd known earlier, maybe I wouldn't have needed to drop out of my dream university because I was suicidal. Maybe I wouldn't have needed to take a gap year after high school to upgrade the courses I didn't hand in work for. Maybe I wouldn't have scared off friends by turning into an empty miserable shell without warning. Experts.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> It was twitter, by the way. A tweeted meme followed by some tik toks got me looking into ADHD. Not the experts.";salllysm;False;80;0.99;2021-02-11 22:02:54;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/lhw1w8/yo_im_straight_up_pissed_livid/;twoxadhd
665;lg8zt2;First day of meds today;"Hello! This is my first post here :) Just wanted to (over)share. <newline>  <newline> I'm 32, not officially diagnosed yet (I think?), elvanse was prescribed as an attempt to see how I adapt given ""many adhd characteristics"" before forwarding diagnosis paperwork to the NHS. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> This is a huge milestone to me and I'm really happy. I struggled all my life with anxiety and depression but because I always got good grades and got a high paying career nobody ever flagged ADHD. It was a revelation to me some years ago, when a coworker shared an article with me about how ADHD can present differently in women (at the time I didnt even know it was a thing adults had). Being somewhat successful has been a major blocker in asking for help actually because everyone assumes I'm fine, but in reality the lengths, the effort and the struggle to get where I am today is so severily draining that I burnout at regular intervals. Often people get mad at me for saying I am not fine, they point at things I accomplished and call me perfectionist and negative, as if my complaint is about the degree of my achievement and not the shit state of my health. Many times I wished to just give up, and go live in a squat or something like that. It's been years that I just can't handle this anymore, I didnt like my jobs but I dont actually like the constant job changes either, I'm on my 10th boyfriend now and I kinda wanna keep this one, and it would be nice to have and maintain some close friendships. I started reading more about ADHD and I can now trace many of my anxiety and work issues to RSD. I think that this new knowledge will be really helpful in managing it. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> This last year, because I reached my rock bottom, I was finally listened to. It took the death of my mother, a pandemic, 1 and half years of unemployment, and me having a full break down \*during\* a consultation for the GP to finally refer me to a psych. This makes me really angry when I think about it.  It's already hard enough to ask for help (I took 4 months to fill the adhd questionnaire they sent me)... But at last I got some help! <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Now I have to deal with some people in my life, including my therapist, saying that I am just going through a lot recently and big pharma wants to turn me into a production zombie for neoliberal forces. I'm anti-fascist with some anarcho-syndicalist tendencies, so it's really hard to argue against this kinda of shit, because on one hand I do agree productivity demands are horrifying, but I also think it's really stupid to use that to gatekeep access to getting individual support when people feel like shit.  I know this topic was taking its rounds on twitter the other day, but I didn't see any actual good material that both recognizes how capitalism is shit for mental health AND that adhd is a valid issue.  I would love to get more resources on this topic from other lefties with ADHD, so if you have any vids or something to recommend of the sort, do let me know. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I start a new job next week, the first job after a long time unemployed and Im massively anxious for that already, but also because I'm not sure yet if Im going to adapt to the meds or if the side effects will be a problem. It's a really shitty timing that this is so close and coinciding, but I'm not sure what would be the alternative (Im in no condition to delay either of these things), at least the work is part time and WFH, so let's see. Wish me luck! <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> UPDATE:  <newline>  <newline> Day 1 on elvanse/vyvanse: Yesterday I took the first dose at 9:30 am after coming back from the pharmacy. Not sure how to measure concentration because Im not working and dont have to do anything in particular. Didn't feel anything for a bit, but at around 11:30 started feeling kinda stressed, which lasted the whole day. I went on a cleaning spree because I causually looked for a document and didn't find it, ended up organizing a bunch of papers and throwing a giant pile of stuff on the trash. Found the document I was looking for and in the process also found [my favorite picture of my mom](https://twitter.com/etiene_d/status/1359136821347778562/photo/1), that I've been looking for for over a year. Felt super emotional but nothing unbearable. Wrote post above. Started watching some How to ADHD youtube videos, recommended by my doctor and thinking about how I discuss this with my therapist. This stressed me out a bunch and I was grinding my teeth a bit after dinner. Didn't have any problems falling asleep ca 10:30pm. Woke up at 3 and didnt manage to sleep again. I do this a lot so I'm not sure it had anything to do with the med. Had the shits. Gave up trying to sleep around 7, because I had a meeting at 8. Took today's dose at 7:20 am.

666;l6cgpb;Things that are meant well but just aren't helpfull that I've come across in the last week or so.;"So, somehow lately I encountered some things that were said with good intention by people who know what they are talking about, but rubbed me the wrong way, and I wanted to share my thoughts. <newline>  <newline>  I don't expect anyone to read through this. I know long texts are difficult. But I had to express my frustration somewhere, and you all have been really supportive.  <newline>  <newline> First, I finally started therapy last week after 10 years or so of being more or less on meds only. My therapist is a really nice guy and I look forward to working with him. But he said something that really rubbed me the wrong way. Translated, it was something along the lines of  <newline> ""You have ADHD. Your brain works different than what society thinks is normal. So you have trouble in situations where other people don't. That does not mean you are sick, or not normal. ADHD is not an illness (I don't know if that is the right word). Instead of you bending youself to what society expects from you, it might be better to bend the expectations to what suits you"".  <newline> And I know, it is really well meant. He wanted to say that I'm not abnormal, that it's okay how I am and that the world we live in is not made for people with ADHD, which is why I  am struggeling, but that does not mean that mean that there is something wrong with me. And that is really nice <newline> Except there is something wrong with me. Which is why I am there. If there were nothing wrong with me, I would not need help (this does not mean that there is something wrong with everyone who has ADHD, just me and my personality). And guess what? I was diagnosed with ADHD over 10 years ago. I accepted that part of me years ago. Telling me that I'm just a bit different makes me  feel like my accomplishments I made despite having ADHD mean nothing. It makes me feel like ADHD isn't all that serious and not that hard, but it is.  <newline> Also, the part of bending the expectations of society to suit me sounds to me like I wasn't good enough to succeed without the ""rules"" being changed. Yes, it probably isn't the best Idea to get a job that requires a lot of organisation, but telling me I will never be able to have such a job and that I should look for one that accommodates for my ADHD (which he did) makes me feel like I am disabled, which I am clearly not. I just want my stuggles taken seriously, but also my accomplishments.  <newline> I will talk about it with him tomorrow, but I had to rant.  <newline>  <newline> Second, I stumbled across the YouTube channel HowToADHD. Some of you may know it, if not I recommend you check it out. It's a great channel, really informative and sometimes funny. But I can't watch her advice Videos. A lot of the advice boils down to ""if you have trouble doing something, try this  thing which requires you to do the thing you struggle with"" or ""if you have trouble doing something, try this other thing which requires another thing that is difficult for people with ADHD"". I'm sure most of it helps others, but for me it just sounds ironic.  <newline>  <newline> If you have made it here, thank you for reading.";CaroMuffin;False;4;0.96;2021-01-27 19:36:35;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/l6cgpb/things_that_are_meant_well_but_just_arent/;twoxadhd

668;kh1aee;How I stay on task with school + full time job.;"Hi ladies! <newline>  <newline> I put most of this down in a comment on another post, but I thought I would create my own in case this can help others. I am in a situation right now where I work a pretty demanding full time job on top of going back to college for computer science, so I don't have time for my brain's bullshit. This is how I have managed so far. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> **Build a Routine:** <newline>  <newline> I'm not as consistent with it as I would like, but I have found that time  blocking my WHOLE DAY helps to eliminate the waiting-for-the-thing  inaction period. I only time block work days, but it's been huge for my  time management. I use [https://getplan.co/](https://getplan.co/),  but I'm sure there's other tools out there - I am not affiliated with them or anything. <newline>  <newline> **Basically, the key for me  is having something assigned to all times, so that I am not making the  ""What do I do now?"" decisions, I'm just moving from block to block doing what I'm told.** <newline>  <newline> [Here is an example of what that looks like for me.](https://imgur.com/a/O6tYEP6)  You'll notice that I give myself a lot of flex time (Break/Emails) and I buffer larger tasks with it so that I am able to keep up with emails  while not being constantly interrupted. I can sometimes keep myself  on task by reminding myself that I can look up whatever has popped into  my head during a Break / Emails block. <newline>  <newline> I know that I am most productive, executive functioning-wise, usually between 9AM and 2PM, so I try to fit more serious tasks in there. Also, I build the time blocking into my  mornings so that I can set up the next day and shift priorities around as needed. <newline>  <newline> Time blocking in combination with morning journaling has really helped me consider and  organize my priorities more effectively. I get out of bed, take my dog  out, make a tea, take my meds, and then sit down at my desk to journal. I do 3 handwritten pages every morning and it can be about anything I  want, but most often I reflect on the prior day, talk about what I want  to accomplish in the current day, and whine about whatever. My meds kick  in while I am already thinking about my priorities/the day ahead, and  this keeps me focused moving into the Time Block / Settle In stage. <newline>  <newline> The journaling I do every morning without fail. The time blocking I did consistently for a few months until it felt like I had a solid handle on  my routine and I bring it back whenever I have a lot going on or feel like I'm slipping up. <newline>  <newline> Turns out all these years the key to getting my shit together (even on meds) was to get up earlier and maintain a highly structured routine. Obviously,  this is more doable for some than others as I work a desk job from home  right now. Anyway, I hope this can help someone! <newline>  <newline> **Reducing Overwhelm:** <newline>  <newline> This has always been my biggest issue. I'm feeling good, I'm getting things done, and then one more thing gets piled on or doesn't go how I planned and all of a sudden I have completely shut down and can't seem do anything that isn't dopamine producing like scroll Reddit or TikTok even though my anxiety is getting higher every second I am doing nothing. Sound familiar? <newline>  <newline> Something that has helped reduce overall I-have-too-many-things-to-do overwhelm is to rotate my main priorities as I need, so instead of thinking of school, work, fitness, etc. all as **equal priorities that I am not doing enough of,** I pick one thing to be A, B, C priority for the day. <newline>  <newline> For example, I know tomorrow I need work to be my main priority, then my workout, then school last because I have already made progress there. School is so last that it didn't even make it on the time block. So, sort of: <newline>  <newline> 1. A Priority - I need to make serious progress on this thing today at the expense of B & C. <newline> 2. B Priority - I would like to make progress, but getting it done is good enough today. <newline> 3. C Priority - I am thinking about this and will give it some time if I have any. <newline>  <newline> This way I am not feeling guilty and overwhelmed by stuff I know that I can't reasonably get to today.";teaearlgreyhot;False;9;0.98;2020-12-20 20:11:12;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/kh1aee/how_i_stay_on_task_with_school_full_time_job/;twoxadhd

670;k4fej9;The Pandemic Has Brought ADHD Symptoms to Light - Anyone Else?;"Hi Everyone. I am a 24 year old college graduate currently in graduate school. I am on the thesis track for my program, and desperately trying to get it finished up to graduate. However, I think the pandemic and my graduate studies have brought light to some ADHD symptoms that I didn't realize I had, and I believe I may have been misdiagnosed as a child. When I was a kid, I went through major episodes of anxiety beginning in fourth grade. However, it was diagnosed as just that: anxiety. I was that little girl who was always ""too chatty,"" to the point where I was moved around the classroom a lot. Also - my brother, dad, uncle, and cousins all have severe cases of ADHD.    <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Fast-forward to my undergraduate career. I never noticed a major problem/symptoms of ADHD, but I have ALWAYS recalled being unable to read, write, etc. without being EXTREMELY distracted. Even the slightest creak, talking, or noise sets me off and I am just out for the count for whatever I was working on. I have very intrusive/distracted thoughts and I have always been a horrible procrastinator, because I have such a hard time getting focused and working through my assignments. Sometimes, when I do get started I hyper focus, but most of the time I am forcing myself to get through things. During undergrad, this was a little bit easier to manage because my projects and assignments were much smaller, and required less time/focus on specific subjects. However, my thesis has become a major problem. I think because it requires so much focus and attention on one specific topic, and I get SO distracted, I am having a really difficult time getting through it. It's come to the point where it has caused a few nervous breakdowns even though I KNOW I can do it.     <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Also- I think the pandemic is causing a lot of other symptoms to crop up because I am working, relaxing, and doing school all in one space. The most distracting thing I have noticed is as follows: I go in to the kitchen to eat because I'm starving. Notice the dishes in the sink, unload the dishwasher and load them all up. See a dirty dishrag and start a load of laundry. See a text on my phone, never answer the text but end up scrolling on Pinterest for 20 minutes. Then go to sit and do some work on the computer just to realize I am hungry and never ate. I can't function if my workspace isn't somewhat organized because I get so distracted. Also- I ran through a traditional ADHD symptom test with my mom, and she brought to my attention my impulsive tendencies that I just thought were part of my personality like, CONSTANTLY talking, speaking over people, and being rather overbearing by blurting out or butting into convos. I also fidget a lot, most noticeably with my hair, in social settings and meetings.    <newline>  <newline>  <newline> So, in the end I'm not 100% sure that it is ADHD, but it would make a LOT of sense if it was. I am wondering what you all think of my situation. I am seeing my primary care doctor on the 15th and plan to bring it up with her.";SchonMeerschweinchen;False;23;1.0;2020-12-01 06:26:01;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/k4fej9/the_pandemic_has_brought_adhd_symptoms_to_light/;twoxadhd

675;jfg2yr;Group for College Girls?;Hi!! I am a 20f in college and my adhd is sooooo bad. I have so much trouble studying and doing work and even just keeping up with daily tasks. It’s even like more difficult bc none of my friends really understand what I’m going through or why I just can’t do it. Even if it’s just one other person that wants to be friends and do this! I think this is something that can help me so much and maybe can help someone else too!  <newline>  <newline> My main issue is I struggle to keep myself accountable, soooooo I wanted to see if there were any other college gals that are struggling w the same issues and wanted to start a group to like talk about it and give advice and also hold each other accountable some how! I know there is already a discord for this Reddit but I just wanted to see if there are any others that are more like me and dealing w these issues! <newline>  <newline> What I can bring to the table: I’ve procrastinated a lot and for a while I did some productive procrastinating and researched a lot of why I procrastinate. I learned a lot about adhd and I understand a lot about it and what makes me procrastinate. So I think I can give knowledgeable advice that may help!  <newline> -Sadly tho this knowledge still isn’t enough for me. Now I just understand why but I still can’t get myself to do it lol. <newline>  <newline> Also I don’t really know how to work discord so depending on how many people actually want to be apart of this we can see if maybe another platform could work and I can always just figure out discord too lolol. <newline>  <newline> Edit: <newline> I created a discord for this!

677;j7s7ix;About to get examined/screened for ADHD tomorrow!;Hey y'all! I just turned 22 and these past few months I have been coming to terms with the possibility that I may be dealing with ADHD. After reading some of the posts within this community, checking out the How to ADHD YouTube channel and also talking to some of my peers who have been recently diagnosed with ADHD I personally can relate to all the symptoms. I was clinically diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and just started my journey on anti-depressants but I am still strongly struggling with focus especially since it's my last semester in college and with everything online I am having trouble not getting distracted, feeling lethargic, irritated, unmotivated, tired and just emotionally exhausted all the time. There are periods of hyper focus and sometimes the drive to do things but it dissipates just as quick.  <newline>  <newline> I also recall an anecdote of my mom telling me I was placed in special education courses when I was in preschool for about a few weeks but my mom couldn't afford it (?) so I was placed back in the traditional classroom. According to her, my teachers had stated that I had trouble focusing and sitting still in class and that interacting with my peers were also difficult... I don't really remember this as I was under the age of 5 but it does make a lot of sense.... <newline>  <newline> I reached out to my psychiatrist and health insurance to look for resources into getting tested and possibly formally diagnosed. There were limited options and also as an adult it is much harder but I was able to secure an initial screening with a psychiatrist tomorrow morning and I am a bit nervous. I was wondering if y'all had any personal experience or any insight to offer about the process and how it went and what to expect. It is much appreciated and thanks so much in advance!;bananabby20;False;4;0.94;2020-10-09 04:00:47;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/j7s7ix/about_to_get_examinedscreened_for_adhd_tomorrow/;twoxadhd

682;hw7a3u;Unofficial diagnosis, taking first meds tomorrow morning;"Hi all, <newline> So a couple of months ago I stumbled upon Dani Donovan's ADHD comics on Twitter, and they felt so familiar I started doing research on ADHD in adults (28). I had an appointment with my psych last week (I have depression and anxiety, diagnosed back in college and relatively well managed), and spoke with him about it, and he essentially said that he ""didn't really want to focus on what brand of alphabet soup I had, but more on What resources I needed to feel better."" And suggested a couple of medication options.  <newline> After more research and thinking I decided on Adderall XR and will be taking my first dosage (10mg) in the AM.  <newline> I feel nervous and excited, and also annoyed at how weirdly dismissive he seemed? Has anyone else had that experience? He was very positive about treatment options and how safe they are, but I found it strange he didn't want to figure out an official diagnosis?  <newline>  <newline> Anyways I just wanted to share and also ask - what should I expect as I begin my medication journey? I did all the usual research on side effect and stuff but am looking for more first- person accounts? It seems so hard to find those online because most articles want to talk about the abuse of stimulants. 🙄";Scampneoroxy;False;1;1.0;2020-07-23 02:10:38;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/hw7a3u/unofficial_diagnosis_taking_first_meds_tomorrow/;twoxadhd
683;hvlzrc;Really unsure/nervous about seeking diagnosis?;"Hiya all, <newline>  <newline> First of all, just want to preface this with a note - I really am very new to using reddit so I'm sorry if this breaks any rules!! I really don't know what I'm doing, in pretty much every sense!! <newline>  <newline> **tldr:** I have a lot of ADHD symptoms but I feel embarrassed about thinking that I might have it, I'm unsure if I even do, and therefore I am really nervous about talking to my doctor about it, because I don't want to feel stupid if it turns out I don't have it. Wondering if anyone has any similar experience or tips about how to get over the fear of being told I don't have it and the embarrassment that would follow? <newline>  <newline> Okay so, I think I might have ADHD, but I'm not totally sure. I've always felt like I'm \~different\~ from other people my own age, but it's only in the last two years or so that I've started to get this overwhelming sense that I'm not functioning like a 23 year old should: <newline>  <newline> * I struggle to remember basic tasks, like brushing my teeth twice a day, doing my laundry, taking my makeup off at the end of the day, etc. <newline> * My room is in a constant state of mess, I could spend hours cleaning it all in one day, swear up and down that this time I'll keep it clean, and within a week it's like I never cleaned it at all. What made me start my research into ADHD was my mother yelling at me again for having a messy room. I get in trouble with her all the time because she wants a neat house (I still live at home) and I leave things everywhere. <newline> * Similarly, I am constantly forgetting to do things I am asked to do, not only at home with chores, but also just in general. I literally cannot function without a list - and it either has to be in Excel and color coded, or in sticky note form so I can change it around. If I write it on paper and tape it to my wall, I'll just stop seeing it at some point. <newline> * I really struggle to focus on my work. I get distracted constantly in college, and I think I have managed to not leave an essay until the night before it's due once in four years. It's like I need the adrenaline of a looming deadline to get me to actually do the work. I also need noise in the background to get any work done, and it specifically has to be loud music with lyrics that I know really well, so that it engages my brain but I don't need to pay attention to it, if that makes sense? <newline> * I constantly have ideas for projects, get really excited about them and do all the planning, and thne never follow through. For example, I've been ""writing"" fanfiction for years, and all I have to show for it is two whole fics, the last of which I completed in 2015. I've started about six different blogs, made maybe three posts, then abandoned it. I desperately want to make YouTube videos, have lists and lists worth of ideas, and nothing to show for it. <newline> * In that same vein, motivation is basically feast or famine. I can't motivate myself to watch most of the tv shows I want to watch, but once I get in the right mood I will binge the whole thing in one go. Same with books, I'll sit and read a whole novel in a day if it grabs my attention. But I can never just sit down and do it. Right now, I have a udemy video editing course open that I have been meaning to start for weeks. I love video editing, but yet for some reason I can't get myself to focus on the course and actually learn. But I really, really want to improve, it's so frustrating!!!! Yet - I'll sit here writing this post for over an hour instead without thinking. <newline> * I also really struggled with motivation during two internships I took last summer, to the point where I was in trouble with one particular manager a lot, and felt like I was letting down the second, because I felt like I wasn't working hard enough. <newline> * I fidget ALL THE TIME. I'm either bouncing one of my legs or tapping my nails off something, without even realising. I've had people tell me multiple times to stop because I'm being loud, distracting, or bouncing so hard I'm shaking a row of seats or the table. I spin bracelets around my finger, throw my phone up and down, or whip my earphones around too. I'm also a big doodler: I destroyed all my school books scribbling lyrics and pictures. I keep my ipad or a sketchbook next to me all the time so I can sketch while I study. <newline> * I keep catching my attention wandering during conversations with friends, unless we're talking about something I'm really interested in. I also feel like I dominate conversations and that I come across as really self-absorbed, which makes me feel really terrible. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> These are just some of the major signs I think I have. There's a ton of other things I relate to, like the idea of object permanence (I can't even tell you how many times I've had to throw out spoilt groceries because I've shoved them in a drawer and forgotten they exist). I've also done a million quizzes, the actual medical screening test, and trawled all the forums and websites, and watched all the videos. I really connect with a lot of posts and other people's stories. <newline>  <newline> BUT. The thought of reaching out for a diagnosis scares the absolute crap out of me. <newline>  <newline> First, I am still unsure that I have it. The voice in my head keeps telling me I 'm just lazy, self-absorbed, and have terrible memory, and that I just need to form new habits and learn to study. <newline>  <newline> Second, I am not struggling in any severe capacity. Yes, my room is a mess and I am constantly in trouble with my parents for forgetting things. But I read about other people who have to work twice as hard as normal people just to pass a class. I don't. In elementary school, I was an overachiever who was placed in advanced reading and math, I coasted through secondary school, averaging at a B/B+ without trying. I just graduated university with a 3.0/4.0 GPA and got accepted into a masters course without overworking myself (although, I did nearly fail the first two years, so it wasn't totally easy). So while I feel like I am not reaching my full potential in any part of my life - I know I am capable of much higher grades, I know I could work a lot harder and be more successful at work - I am still doing pretty well. <newline>  <newline> Third, I don't know if any of this was present before age 12, which I know is a key part of diagnosis. I talked to my mom about it, and she says that I was never in trouble with teachers for not paying attention in class, I always did my homework, definitely spent too much time on the computer and was messy, but not more than any other child my age. I was chatty (still am), and definitely very imaginative, but she wouldn't have said I was much of a daydreamer.However, that being said, I do remember the last year or two of elementary, so when I was about 12/13, and I remember not listening in class: I would always be doodling, or skipping ahead and completing work before everyone else, and getting in trouble for talking. In secondary school onwards, as I said, I still got really good grades without having to try, but I definitely wasn't paying attention in class anymore. I distinctly remember my German teacher complaining to my mother about how I would obviously be not paying attention, but when she asked me a question I would be able to answer without issue. I used to just pay enough attention so that I knew vaguely where we were on the page so that I wouldn't get in trouble. I stopped turning in homework to classes where I could get away with it, and I didn't study for my Leaving Cert (basically Irish college entry exams) at all. <newline>  <newline> Fourth, I just feel embarrassed about it. Not about the concept of having ADHD - I don't see it as embarrassing. If anything, I nearly want the diagnosis, because it would justify all the things that I see as my negative personality traits. But I feel embarrassed about thinking I might have it, when I am not struggling in any hugely detrimental way. <newline>  <newline> Finally, I'm really nervous about talking to my doctor, because I am terrified of feeling like an idiot if she tells me I don't have it, and that I really am just lazy with bad habits. She's also not fantastic with neurodivergent/mental health issues, but I'm not really in a position to seek out a new doctor (rural Ireland is not leaving me with much choice!) I'm also afraid that she might think I'm seeking out a diagnosis to get my hands on medication, because there has been cases of adderall abuse by undiagnosed kids at my university for study purposes. <newline>  <newline> SO - has anyone else had similar feelings about seeking diagnosis? How did you pluck up the courage to go for it, and how did it go for you? Any tips on how to broach the topic with my doctor? For example, should I maybe just write all my symptoms out and let her come to the conclusion herself, rather than even mentioning ADHD at all? Or should I tell her I suspect, from my own research, that this might be the case, and seek a referral? Do you think it's worth my time, given all the info I've provided (obviously not expecting any professional advice on this part, but I guess some input on my symptoms from people with a diagnosis would be appreciated, especially if you're diagnosed and have similar experience)? <newline>  <newline> Thank you for reading my very lengthy post!! :) - Sinead";scryan18;False;21;1.0;2020-07-22 03:09:25;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/hvlzrc/really_unsurenervous_about_seeking_diagnosis/;twoxadhd

690;gf7se3;Just got an appointment for today!; I'm very nervous about how things are going to unfold with the doctor (to the point of almost crying), I keep thinking he's going to be dissmissive and think I'm faking it, part of it because I've been pushing the idea of having ADHD to the back of my mind since 2018 and the other part because the last doctor I saw didn't really care for my attention issues.  <newline>  <newline>  But yesterday I was mindlessly scrolling trough Instagram and I saw a post someone made about the way they added numbers and how they found out it wasn't how everyone else did it (it was something like not being able to add 7+6 directly, instead making first a 10 with 7+3, making it 10 + 3). A lot of people commented they also did it that way and that they had either ADHD or ASD.  <newline>  <newline>  This made me read again about ADHD symptoms on adult women and feeling again like my life struggles were being laid in front of my eyes, in fact, I didn't sleep at all last night because I couldn't stop reading about it.  <newline>  <newline>  Between that and having been feeling unhappy with myself this past two months I decided that I would make an appointment in the morning and try again to feel like I have some control on my life. Probably because of the virus, the place I called had an hour available for today at 14:30 so I took it!  <newline>  <newline>  I'm trying again and I hope this time I get a good enough doctor that actually takes the time to listen to me.;nonominx;False;9;0.94;2020-05-07 14:41:56;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/gf7se3/just_got_an_appointment_for_today/;twoxadhd
691;g6rguw;What no one prepared me for before testing.;"Hey, r/TwoXADHD! <newline>  <newline> This afternoon, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD-Combined Presentation. It was a \*long\* journey (even longer with all the quarantine nonsense), but I finally got to what feels like a mile marker.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> So, on to the point of this post! For \*months\* I trolled ADHD subs, youtube, and web MD pages, and still felt like I had no idea how I was ever going to get help, or if I even needed it. I feel like they taught me a lot, but one thing they \*never\* explained was what the testing looked like. Obviously, I'm not going to give it all away, but I do have some things I want to put out there to ease some people's anxiety.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> \*If your testing is anything like mine:\* <newline>  <newline> * You will have to give a background on yourself. Easy and to be expected right?  <newline> * You will also have to complete a couple of questionnaires about yourself, again super easy, nothing to stress about.  <newline> * They may ask you to have a close person (spouse, parent, roommate, ect...) to fill out a questionnaire. That's a little more stressful, but I'm sure you have someone you can trust. <newline> *  Now, the part I found truly stressful was the ""testing"" part. I was given several cognitive ability tests. They are a bunch of quick (5-10 min) tests that check your reading, writing, and math skills. Whatever you do, just try your best. I thought I was straight up failing some and others I thought I was breezing through. These are NOT checking for ADHD, they are checking your ability to think cognitively. Like the new version of an IQ test, and ADHD doesn't affect your IQ. Just take a deep breath, ask for breaks if you need them, and do your best. I found myself getting incredibly overwhelmed and giving up on some. I still did perfectly fine. All these tests did was prove to me I am \*not\* an idiot. I am perfectly smart, my brain just doesn't work the same as other people.  <newline>  <newline> Good luck peeps.

693;dsf0wz;Do I have ADHD?;Hi! <newline>  <newline> I'm not sure if my question is very appropriate but I would really appreciate all the insight I can get, thank you! <newline>  <newline> I'm 21 now and I've always somewhat wondered if I have ADHD because I'm very fidgety, and always been bad with deadlines, time management and paying attention. But, I've also always done quite well in school and so I dismissed the thought. But this is a line of thought that I've wondered about since I was 15. <newline>  <newline> But ever since entering university, things have really gotten harder for me. I can't study well or do my assignments well until it's the day before. I actively try to work against this laziness by coming up with study plans and to do lists but I still find it very hard. Sometimes it's like I just can't start? Like as though there's a whole boulder stopping me and try as I might, I just can't push myself to start and then focus enough to get things done early. It's only when the pressure's mounting then I'm able to get things done. And even then, my work submitted isn't the best and I'm always not fully studying for my exams. <newline>  <newline> This semester has particularly been hard because I've been more assignment based and so far, I've handed in every assignment in late. And because of that - the inability to do things on time and the knowledge that I'm not doing as well as I can, I'm wrecked with anxiety. Everyday feels like I'm just choking on air and I'm nauseous and it just feels like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop - which really is the most horrible feeling to deal with everyday. <newline>  <newline> In general, I also daydream alot. Like, walking around - I'm almost always daydreaming. In conversations with friends, I've also found myself drifting away or even coming up with a whole different conversation in my head - and then I actually respond to the conversation in my head instead of real life. Thankfully my friends are okay with this and it hasn't caused problems. In lectures, I can never pay full attention unlesss it's something that I really like - then I really am able to force myself to actively take notes and stuff. <newline>  <newline> But also, I'm able to concentrate, in fact, almost manically, on things I like. I can lose myself in books or my art for hours. I'll start at 10pm and then finish and realise that it's the next morning, 10am. But to me, it really only felt like an hour or two. And this what evidence my parents use to tell me I don't have ADHD or a problem with focus, that I'm really just lazy. <newline>  <newline> Looking at other symptoms, I definitely resonate with them as well. <newline>  <newline> I've always felt like I'm filled with boundless energy and I just want to cartwheel or sprint down the street. But I'm also able to control the impulse to move around in classes or meetings. I just tend to jiggle my leg alot or play with my hands or stationery. <newline>  <newline> I also have really low frustration tolerance. I cry very easily or get angry and defensive super easily. To a certain extent, I've also been able to somewhat control the crying outbursts because of my pride. But recently, it has become a problem and I've been breaking down in public or arguing with my parents. I get super upset and sometimes I feel like the anger is something that I'm unable to control and it's just bursting out of me and that further amplifies my restlessness. <newline>  <newline> Recently, I also read about Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria and how its associated with ADHD and this is the thing that I really really relate to? Does anyone else also relate to it? I've always had high standards for myself, been very very needy of affirmation from parents, friends and my exes, super hard and critical on myself and really very very intolerant of any perceived form of rejection. With my ex, I would delete my entire whatsapp messaging app for days just so that I wouldn't have to see and feel the rejection he would give when we fought. Or I'd do so much to please him just because I wanted his affirmation. So RSD, really is what made me really really feel that ADHD is something that I might have. <newline>  <newline> I brought my feelings up to my parents and they feel that I don't have ADHD because I've never had bad feedback from teachers (which honestly, I was a talkative student but I was never super problematic. I was also in the 'best' class for my school so teachers often turned a blind eye to my late/absent work). And they feel that I'm able to focus and stuff. Which, I am able to focus but I find it very hard to achieve. And I just feel that I'd rather get some help than have to continually struggle and underperform. <newline>  <newline> Does anyone relate to my symptoms/experience? Am I thinking too much or do I possibly have ADHD to some extent? Again, I'm really only exploring this now because I feel that it really is causing significant distress to my life. <newline>  <newline> Thank you for all and any responses, I really do and will appreciate them. <newline>  <newline> Edit: Wanted to add that I've always been the messiest person in my family. I moved back home from campus almost 6 months ago but I still have clothes stuffed into a suitcase or notes and textbooks that I keep intending to pack and throw but I just never do? And even after packing my room, it's messy in an hour.;sadfishie;False;4;0.92;2019-11-06 11:30:34;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/dsf0wz/do_i_have_adhd/;twoxadhd
694;da6msb;Dealing with the inevitable crash and burn;I got formally diagnosed adhd inattentive around this time last year. I was already diagnosed with depression and general/social anxiety. My doctor felt that my ADHD was really fueling my other issues.  <newline>  <newline> Over several months I got settled on 30mg of Adderall XR. It was such a drastic change. I could focus, I wasn't constantly boredom eating, and I could stick to plans with little effort. I was less nervous around people, happier in general, heck I even got over my terrible acrophobia for a good while.  <newline>  <newline> I've mostly kept my walking routine and I've lost right around 100lbs.  <newline>  <newline> Something else I changed was I finally took the initiative to start running a ttrpg game with a women's gaming group. Not d&d, but I joined a couple of those too.  <newline>  <newline> The game I ran had a pretty steady group that met up but weekly. I slowly got into the groove and really started to get into our story.  <newline>  <newline> Well, this summer my work load more than doubled, I dropped my other games as it was too much to handle. I didn't want to cancel or go on hiatus as I know most games don't recover. I knuckled down and made every single game even when I felt like roadkill running on two misfiring braincells. My players seemed fine with everything even as I tried to apologize for not being at my best.  <newline>  <newline> Thankfully summer started to wind down and my schedule was about to return to normal. I was stoked as the 1 year anniversary of our game was coming up and close enough to Halloween to combine a sweet spooky game with a spooky party.  <newline>  <newline> So a few days before I was to head out of town a major player dropped out due to work. The game before she had to cancel last minute and couldn't contribute to the two month schedule we had to give the game shop to hold the private room we play in. After she left another players suggested I wrap up the story and start over with new players. I was crushed, but said I was already planning on zipping up the current arc.  <newline>  <newline> Well two days before our game same players sends a Facebook link for a d&d meet and greet the shop was hosting just and hour after the game starts. Said the owner had asked us to be there to show the shop support. I said no problem, we're gunna be there anyway. She again suggests I find new players. <newline>  <newline> I really crammed to get everything prepared so o can finish the story within the three days we have the room for. Day before I'm getting ready to print when that nagging voice gets to me. I just asked if they were even interested in finishing. One said she was down, the other didn't answer, which I took as the answer. The last arc was entirely built on her back story. I didn't waste my ink. <newline>  <newline>  I pretty much forced myself to go, I didn't have much hope, but I tried to be optimistic.  <newline>  <newline> Well, lo and behold , everyone was there for d&d. A few people humored me by asking about the system I was using , but were clearly much less interested in the entire genre I was running.  <newline> I got one super friendly guy that was willing to try a one shot, but I'm bad at those. So, I still have a hold on a room I have no more use for.  <newline>  <newline> I know this is mostly the rsd flaring up, but I'm just feeling very empty about it all now. More so when my two lost players joined a d&d group ones husband runs.  <newline>  <newline> I've invested so much time and money into this hobby and now I'm ready to just drop it. So until I can see my doctor , has anyone else delt with similar situations? Can I go back to loving this hobby after feeling so utterly rejected by it?  <newline> Right now I feel like I was never any good at it and was just wasting everyone's time.;Thedaspokesman;False;2;0.85;2019-09-27 21:11:33;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/da6msb/dealing_with_the_inevitable_crash_and_burn/;twoxadhd
695;d5b4l6;adhd people drawn to each other?;When I was in middle school my counselor helped me a lot - so much so when I had really bad days at high school I would leave high school and walk to the middle school a few miles away to talk to him. <newline>  <newline> My pottery teacher while I was struggling to support myself before going back to school was someone I admired and always had good advice. <newline>  <newline> At the job where I worked where I had my anxiety and depression largely due to undiagnosed adhd and an uncooperative manager when I tried to ask for help coping with the noise (seating arrangments, modular wall changes, etc), there was a coworker who I became friends with on facebook. <newline>  <newline> When I announced my adhd on facebook, the coworker shared they were also adhd. I’m returning to pottery now that I have a steady job and learning to make my own glazes - it requires focus - my pottery teacher also has adhd and shared coping strategies. And I reached out to my middle school counselor to ask if there were records or notes I could access in case I needed them for therapy. Turns out he has adhd and was on Adderall while he was my counselor.  <newline>  <newline> I find it fascinating that the people I like best and have been the most patient and kind with me have also had adhd. Also kind of mind boggling I wasn’t diagnosed in middle school but I had a lot of family trauma disguising things too.;binarystitch;False;3;1.0;2019-09-17 03:04:18;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/d5b4l6/adhd_people_drawn_to_each_other/;twoxadhd

699;bsb10f;Suspecting ADHD [F31] Anyone care to give their opinion?;"Not even sure how to start this. Basically, in the past year or two I've come to realise that a lot of memes and stories from people with ADHD resonate a lot with me (while others don't at all). So this has started me wondering whether I might actually have a form of ADHD that just went completely unnoticed by everyone around me because I was doing well in school, wasn't loud or hyperactive (rather the opposite: total daydreamer, would read or play legos for hours on end, or waste an entire afternoon because math homework was too boring for me so I'd read the whole mathbook instead of focusing on the few exercises we had to do at home even though they were easy for me). <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I definitely have some kind of executive dysfunction (because no one can tell me it's just me being ""lazy"" if I need to pee and still continue browsing the internet for another hour even though I want to play a game, but don't want to start because I need to pee first...) <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I've always been a daydreamer to the point where I would just ""check out"" of school lessons to follow my train of thought or daydream ""story"". It never really led to big problems because school was really easy for me most of the time so I got good grades. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> In university, I remember a lot of classes where I had to have my iPad with Facebook open to keep me busy while listening to our prof with part of my focus because I would have trailed off completely or fallen asleep without Faceboo to distract me, even when that class was really interesting. Not sure whether this was just from exhaustion, though. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Easy stuff, especially repetitive stuff (like math homework that consisted of 25 exercises of the same type that I could do in my head but had to write down step by step) was so boring that I would literally waste hours trying to avoid it instead of simply doing it to be free to do what I wanted. Difficult stuff, on the other hand, intrigued me so much that I could spend hours trying to solve a puzzle or hard math problem. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Wasting time browsing the same two or three tabs on the internet because I don't know what I want to do, or I do know but can't get myself to switch tasks and start, or I do know but don't have the focus or concentration for it. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Not being able to get up to make myself a cup of tea for an hour but when my husband comes home exhausted, I can suddenly get up to make him one (and myself while I'm finally in the kitchen). <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Having to trick myself/eliminate steps to actually do something I have planned, like when I want to go to the gym, having my bag ready to go the evening before and then in the morning getting dressed in my outside clothes right away instead of first switching into my comfy inside clothes because if I'm already dressed for outside, it's as easy/difficult to just go than to switch into comfy clothes... <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> There's probably more but those are the things I can think of right now. Important to mention: I do have fibromyalgia (diagnosed in 2017, symptoms probably since early childhood, always dismissed back then), so a lot of the concentration and focus problems could just stem from that, although I don't seem to hear/read a lot about executive dysfunction from fibro warriors (also, ""executive dysfunction"" is not something people in Germany seem to be widely aware of: I only learned about it from US-centric spoonie groups). <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> To seek a diagnosis/professional assessment, I wouldn't even know how to get started, especially as I've read during one of my research sprees that apparently ADHD isn't really diagnosed anymore in adults if symptoms can't be proven from childhood (at least in Germany? Unless that info is plain wrong even for here...): plus I've had some really bad experiences with psychotherapists and don't trust them anymore (and generally had a lot of bad experiences with doctors so I hate hate hate having to go to a new-to-me doctor--the last one traumatised me).";Miro_the_Dragon;False;36;0.91;2019-05-24 01:35:02;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/bsb10f/suspecting_adhd_f31_anyone_care_to_give_their/;twoxadhd

702;at76tm;Stay at home mom, perfected Scottish accent today. Thanks adhd.;"My 4 year old's preschool permanently closed last month. We were suppose to be in the ""time to myself finally"" portion of my life. But now it's back to 24/7 child rearing. The 4 months he was in school was perfect. I got to exercise and spend hours writing computer code. Now my brain is dying. I lift weight, do jiu jitsu in the mornings and run. I study for my personal trainer cert when they're in bed but during the day I am losing my mind! So just to make things interesting I've watched/listening in the background a lot of videos on youTube on the Scottish accent (Edinburgh for now) last night and today and it's the only way I've been speaking all day.

704;9t8me9;How to cope until you diagnosis appointment?;"Hi everyone, my name is Anna, I am 27 and I am quite sure that I am a member of the ADHD gang. My city has a special center for ADHD in adults as part of the university clinic - but I have to wait for my test appointment for three months. Actually the wait time is almost over but it was postponed for another 3 weeks. And I am starting to fall apart.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I seem to be blessed with comorbidities like anxienty and especially eating disorder, binging away everything that comes into my way. I was able to maintain my already obese weight of 180 pounds for the last 1,5 years, but since the diagnosis is on the line I just let go and cannot seem to get myself together as always the thought plops up "" this is your brain and it won't change, why should you try if you just dissapoint yourself in the end anyway?"" I gained 16 pounds in the last 2,5 months. Many of you describe their diagnosis as a changing point of relief because they found a reason. For me it was kind of depressing as I now might know the reason now but it is a chronic problem and help (medication) is far away, as the first appointment is just for the test, the second one for evaluation and maybe a third appointment for starting real treatment. How do you guys cope with that situation or maybe times, when you are struggeling and you are unmedicated? <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> This was the post and my questions, here some of my background story - no must read, as the post is really long already... :)   <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I am quite sure that I have ADHD, I discovered the matter via an ENFP subreddit that recommended ADHD Youtube videos and I immeadiately recognized myself in the descriptions and took loads of self tests, also clinical ones and ""passed"" with flying flaggs. I also have to bring my elementary school certificates and first wondered why. But then read my 3 sentence long evaluation from 3rd grade and noticed a symptom in every sentence: ""Anna's attention is fluctuating and strongly topic related. She needs to be less impulsive. Anna should focus more on having here school materials in order and do her homework more often"". Tbh this was the point when I had no doubt anymore that I have had ADHD since my childhood and was never diagnosed.     <newline>  <newline> Not to be arrogant, but I guess I had no problems in school because I was blessed to get a few IQ points extra and never had to put in a lot of work to get good grades. I could not keep up with this during university and it took me double as long to finish my Bachelor's degree due to distractions like a beauty Youtube channel (and the resulting shopping addiction), volunteering in the students council, internships and lots of Sims gaming and series binging. If it is new and exciting I can be extraordinary, if it gets boring and dull I procrastinate until eternity or a hard deadline with dramatic consequences comes around. I now have my 3rd job in 4 years and I am thinking of changing again due to boredom. I have always been mess, only cleaning when someone is visiting and waiting with it until the last minute - then crying because I hate it so much and don't want to do it, but have to. I am collecting so much stuff and buying impulsively - I have had a good salary for the past 3 years and never managed to have any savings - relying on my parents for emergencies, even though I moved out 10 years ago. I am just so tired of going to bed with the wish to make everything beeter in the morning and being in the same situation again every night. And I am worried about my health due to obesity.";FreakyViolet;False;2;0.89;2018-11-01 11:36:12;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/9t8me9/how_to_cope_until_you_diagnosis_appointment/;twoxadhd
705;8rnlqy;ADHD and breakups: anyone else feel like a gasoline fire?;**Content warning:** brief mention of self harm. <newline>  <newline> Quick background: 23, cis female, diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. Up until that point, I had been treated for dysthimia and anxiety for seven years. I’ve had a few romantic relationships but I often describe them as being like “gasoline fires--“sudden, intense, and then just as suddenly gone, leaving absolute wreckage in their wake. <newline>  <newline> Anyone else have a *really* hard time with breakups? <newline>  <newline> I know breakups are really hard for anyone. But comparing the way my non-ADHD friends handle breakups and the way I usually do, it seems to take me a lot longer to get over someone. I’ve always known that my emotional responses are much more intense than other people expect them to be--now that I know I have ADHD, I recognize it as emotional hyperarousal/maybe RSD. But even after seven years of therapy, I still don't really know how to deal with them. <newline>  <newline> Generally in the midst of a breakup, I’ll start to run my mouth and say some really intense stuff to my ex, and then spiral out afterwards. I know spiraling is part of it for everyone, but like........ I’ll *really* spiral out. Example: a couple of hours  after my first boyfriend dumped me when I was fifteen, I cut myself. And then that became a coping mechanism for a while. Yes, lots of people cut themselves, but for other people I know, it's usually a slow buildup that finally made them do it. For me, all it took was being broken up with and I was already there. <newline>  <newline> And now, I’m eighteen months into the aftermath of a breakup, and I still miss him brutally. There’s a lot of guilt, too, and shame, wrapped up in this breakup. I now recognize the ways in which my then-untreated ADHD played a role. I still haven’t fully forgiven myself, even though it was an honest mistake, truly, but an honest mistake after several other honest mistakes/panic-induced snap decisions that put my partner through some real emotional whiplash. And If I look even further back, I see how my ADHD affected other romantic relationships I’ve had. In some good ways--I’m usually a very attentive, very affectionate partner. But in lots of bad ways too. Like suddenly and unceremoniously ending a mostly stable eighteen-month relationship over Skype. (Different ex, but still.) <newline>  <newline> I’m looking for others like me. Please share your own breakup stories, if you feel comfortable. I think that would help me feel less alone. Because I do feel incredibly alone, in more ways than just this. **And also, how do you begin to manage the intense feelings that often accompany ADHD?** They just feel like so *much*: even if I crack open the door just a tiny bit I’m afraid they’ll swallow me whole. But I can't go on alternating between tamping them down and then being flooded and overpowered by them to the point that I have to cancel plans at the last minute, or go into the back room at work to cry.

706;5n6ya0;Would any of you guys be interested in helping me?;"Yo lovely mod ladies, if this is an unapproved Bad Thing I totally understand it being deleted! <newline>  <newline> So, my uni course is English.  I don't know *what* I intend to do with it after the degree is over, but it is showing me I have many options.  Anyway, as expected the majority of those options are writing based. <newline>  <newline> I need to write more to improve my skills, kinda like reading - the more you do it, the better you get.  I've got a blog but it is only updated once every few months (sometimes a couple of times that month) because it seems a Big Thing so I put off doing the posts regardless of actually enjoying the writing as I have to sit down, think about what I am writing, make it pretty, remember what I planned to write etc.  So, new plan is a Facebook page.

707;539f5g;Newly diagnosed at 41;I've always known something wasn't quite right with me. I could never seem to do the things other people could do, like clean regularly, organize, or finish projects. My therapist suggested I might be ADHD. I talked about it with my psychiatrist (treating me for bipolar depression) and he initially dismissed the idea because I'm not hyperactive. I pushed back, though, so he gave me a written test. Based on that he prescribed me Adderall XR 10 mg. I've been on it for four days, and I can already feel improvements. <newline>  <newline> The problem I am having now is directing my new-found focus in the right direction.

708;4biwo5;I hate myself;I ruined my first day back to my diet. I've told my SO that I'm on a diet and still he brings me all of my favorite foods (that I can't eat) anyway. He does this whether I'm on a diet or not and will argue that ketogenic diets aren't healthy (doesn't matter that I lost 40+ lbs the first time, improved my bloodwork, felt less depressed, improved my concentration). I resent that the first time I did keto he kept bringing me foods that he thought I liked as an affectionate thing and kept disregarding how upsetting it was for me to have to decline them. It's so confusing - you're doing something affectionate (gifting food) because you love me, but you're doing the opposite of what I need and don't care that it's upsetting me. It makes no sense. <newline>  <newline> It's my responsibility to refuse and yesterday I didn't. Today was worse: we had a particularly stressful fight right before lunch and I went outside to cry in my car and ended up driving 20 minutes to the grocery store to buy a bag of chocolate (which I then ate a large portion of). <newline>  <newline> I love my SO but living with him is always so difficult. He's argumentative about everything. I don't know why he's like that, he's always been that way. We've been fighting for days now. Whatever his emotional problems are he takes them out on me. I 'treat him like shit', act like a 'vicious asshole', I'm trying to 'control' him. None of that is true and it's the fastest way to make my ADHD hypersensitivity kick into high gear. <newline>  <newline> That's where the binge eating comes in. I'm struggling to regulate emotions because I'm dealing with someone who is acting irrationally and hurling accusations at me and I end up either playing into it and giving him more fuel by trying to reason with him or I just go straight for the easy fix. I knew chocolate would give me a temporary mood boost, and chose to ignore that I was self sabotaging. <newline>  <newline> I took my third dose for the day earlier than I was supposed to so that I'd get an extra kick so that I could keep functioning at work even though I feel like I'm falling apart inside. <newline>  <newline> There's no middle ground. There's just mania and despair. The moments of despair are so painful it's scary. Has anyone ever seen this scene from Sanctum? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so0_CFq9hv4 <newline>  <newline> That's the only way I can describe it. I'm afraid I'll do something out of panic because I want the pain to stop. I'm raving right now  but I think that maybe writing it out will help me stay calm and prevent me from falling further down the rabbit hole.;PM_ME_UR_DRAGONBORN;False;6;1.0;2016-03-22 19:16:17;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/4biwo5/i_hate_myself/;twoxadhd

710;454h1e;Thoughts on being organized...;Hi friends. <newline>  <newline> I wanted to talk a bit about organizing. It's typical that ADHDers have trouble organizing themselves. But we also thrive within an organized setting - when it's our own system.  I've been able to go to grad school full-time and run my own business because of the organizational abilities I've developed.... it's NOT impossible for us ADHDers to succeed!! The key is organization. And each and every one of us needs our own system, made just for us. <newline>  <newline> Soo... First off, what's your system? What do you have perfected? What are you working on? <newline>  <newline> I've been working on my own organization system for the past 5 years. It includes a paper planner (daily/monthly/weekly todos and charts) and a digital calendar component - and now WorkFlowy. I find WorkFlowy is better than Evernote, because of the layers you can create. I also like it more than Trello, because it's cleaner and sleeker. (I use Pinterest for all image and website related organizings) WorkFlowy is AMAZING. I'm using it for everything - personal, business, home, body (health-fitness). If you want to check it out, here's an invite link that gets you 2x more free space: https://workflowy.com/invite/2ed904df.emlx - and it gets me space too! <newline>  <newline> If you're looking for a first step, just start with creating some major categories. These can be used as headers on a ToDos list, or calendar groups on your phone. <newline>  <newline> Mine are: <newline>  <newline> Grad School (homework, assignments, reading, etc) <newline>  <newline> Business/Work (both working and prep hours) <newline>  <newline> Home (bills, repairs, improvements, etc) <newline>  <newline> Office (inc Financial) <newline>  <newline> Personal <newline>  <newline> Music/Studio <newline>  <newline> Body (Health, Medical, Fitness) <newline>  <newline>  <newline> --- <newline>  <newline> Hope this helps!! <newline> ;alaskafound;False;8;1.0;2016-02-10 19:27:53;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/454h1e/thoughts_on_being_organized/;twoxadhd
711;40rlg9;Meds and side effects;Hello ladies. Lurked here for a while and found much solace from your sharings. I'm undiagnosed and running wild, could write a long rant about why I suspect I'm ADHD, but anyway something happened yesterday which kind of tipped the scales on my urgency level of doing something about it. I was getting my kid dinner and decided to make myself available for a business call as it was probably going to be pretty brief, exchanged a couple of emails about it. The next time it even entered my mind was late that night after my child was asleep and it occurred to me to check my email again and I saw I had a Skype voicemail about it. Mind you I have a smartphone, I didn't need to make any effort to check mail - just remember to. <newline>  <newline> Like... I can sort of handle the forgetting of keys every time I need them, the doing ten tasks at the same time and not finishing any of them properly, being unable to access my mind when asked a question I know the answer to, and allowing myself to unwind and zone out with internet or xbox mind chewing gum - at least I have some level of productivity going on and can just about bear my life. But dropping the ball on a work call and not giving it a second thought is like, dangerous territory IMHO. <newline>  <newline> So this is the first time I've seriously considered the idea of meds. I'm generally inclined not to dabble in any medication whatsoever as even over the counter stuff doesn't do what it's supposed to do to me, I need extra doses of anaesthetic etc. And while I'm interested in informed experimentation with mind expanding chemicals, the idea of constantly dosing your brain with something seems dangerous to me (especially in light of my weird reactions/sensitivity). So the idea of meds is SCARY for me. Most especially the risk of affecting sex drive - my healthy sex drive seems intrinsic to my being and gives me so much joy and human connection and I don't want to sacrifice it to be a functioning adult because what kind of life would that be!? <newline>  <newline> So I guess I'm looking for anecdotal evidence about how meds have affected your sex lives, if it's bad how you've coped, if it has been fine... or any magical tips you have for not doing what I did yesterday.;vitreouscannon;False;4;1.0;2016-01-13 11:11:19;/r/TwoXADHD/comments/40rlg9/meds_and_side_effects/;twoxadhd

713;3lldsd;Newly Diagnosed and Medicated: A weekly report;"Hi Everyone! <newline>  <newline> So I'm a long time lurker, 1st time poster. My name is Odessa and I'm newly diagnosed with ADHD. I wanted to share with you my journey in hopes of helping others and self reflection. <newline>  <newline> Well, I'm in my mid 30s and just got diagnosed last month. I work in the mental health field and had noticed my symptoms were getting worse... <newline>  <newline> *Where are my keys for work? <newline>  <newline> *What patient am I meeting today? <newline>  <newline> *Go to the grocery store, have a list written, have a text and **STILL** can't remember the one thing I came in here for!!! <newline>  <newline> *Being depressed because I'm in my 30s,not my 80s! I should remember things!! <newline>  <newline> *Increased mood swings because people would remind me of what I forgot, and due to feeling embarrassed I would argue that everyone else was wrong... <newline>  <newline> **The list goes on** <newline>  <newline> So just when I felt like giving up and just settling with a new title of being a Ditz or a space cadet, I actually met one of the mods in a different subreddit. She seemed nice enough so I looked at her post history and saw, oh my God! I'm not alone! There are other people just like me!!! I came here and started looking around and suddenly it all made sense! I'm not stupid or lazy... I'm just a little different!!! <newline>  <newline> I took the quiz on the side panel and scored 14 out of 15. Also because I work in mental health, I am in doctor, therapist, and other mental health professional offices, I found another brochure that had information on adult adhd and another quiz. I took a big leap of faith, knowing I couldn't do **this** by myself and called one of the places I bring my patients to. I didn't want to see the same doctors they see, but the location of the facility is good and it has a nice, calm, atmosphere. <newline>  <newline> From there, I met with a therapist...expressed my issues and although I'm not sure I will stick to this lady or not (she's an older lady, that doesn't seem to ""get me""), she did ask if I wanted to be medicated for my adhd. That was a decision that needed to be made in a split second, but something I really had to think about. I have never taken anything stronger than an antibiotic (except for blood pressure) and taking something for adhd was a difficult decision. But I knew how my life has been thus far, **WITHOUT** medication...and it's been hard... I agreed and had to make an appointment with a medication provider (ie a DR, not just a therapist). <newline>  <newline> I met with this Doctor, (who I will now refer to as Dr. Sheldon Cooper... He had about as much empathy as Sheldon asking Penny why she is crying...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n38eAO3ne8M) <newline>  <newline> But he did write me a prescription for adderall. 10mg twice a day. He explained that it is a narcotic and to keep it safe, and that it would work more effectively the LESS I took it.  <newline>  <newline> So that's that everyone. If you like what I posted and I didn't bore you to death, comment below and I will explain what Week 1 of Adderall has been like in another post.

718;3ecmye;[Rant] the REAL reason I hate mice and bugs;Streaking shadows and undefined shapes that move on the edges of my peripheral vision, pervasive wandering itches on my skin, and ghost sounds are all things I've dealt with my entire life.  And that's okay, because I know they're not real.  They're false positives, excess sensory input created because of my brain's wonky chemistry.  I can ignore them and they don't affect my life because *I know they aren't real*.   <newline>  <newline> But mice and ants and spiders and other pests... I hate them.  I hate them because they **ARE** real.  When we get ants or a family of mice move in or there's a spider in my bathtub they're real and worse, there's probably more than what I'm seeing in front of me.  And that means I ***can't*** ignore all the false positives because they might be real, too.  Every itch on my leg could be an ant or a spider, every streak of movement or weird noise might be a mouse and it sucks.  It fucking sucks.  I become paranoid and twitchy because I can't tune out the extraneous stuff and it wrecks my ability to manage all my other ADD symptoms. <newline>  <newline> The only person I've ever told in my entire life about the moving shadows and sounds is my husband, so I can't bitch about fucking mice on facebook without seriously scaring everyone I know.

720;134bzjl;Diagnosis Guilt & Imaginary ADHD;At the insistent direction of my female therapist who’s proudly diagnosed, I’m going for ADHD screening on Wednesday.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve just turned twenty. My entire life I’ve struggled with every single symptom that you all talk about in this subreddit, and for the past year, I’ve been lurking around here and lurking around the psychology section of my local library in search of validation for issues that I’ve dealt with my entire life. <newline>  <newline> I’ve gotten screamed at by my mom for so easily forgetting chores and homework, for as long as I can remember. For three years in a row, I’ve cried over burnt birthday dinners’ I’ve tried to make for my sister. <newline>  <newline> I’ve bounced back and forth with my weight loss journey, because I can’t stick to a routine to save my life.  <newline>  <newline> When I was as young as seven, on my own volition, I would use my moms’ computer to print ‘Daily Schedules’ to try and keep myself organized, and every single one ended up in the trash after one month.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on impulsive purchases and hundreds of hours on hobbies instead of studying for my drivers’ test or job hunting.  <newline>  <newline> And I’ve faced the overbearing guilt, shame, and disappointment from my mother of never even graduating high school because of the difficulty I had focusing and handling something so simple as an essay for English. Even if the passion was there.  <newline>  <newline> I’ve been described as spacey and weird all my life, and until I found this subreddit and a few YouTube videos, I thought I was the only person who felt that way. <newline>  <newline> I should be thrilled to be getting diagnosed. All of my questions will be answered. But, all I can feel is fearful.  <newline>  <newline> On one hand, I feel like if it comes out to be ADHD, I’ll be glad that I finally know what’s been happening to me for all my life, and maybe then, if I get on medication, some aspects will finally come together. I want to get a job, finish my novels, and live out my twenties like I’ve always wanted, traveling with my sister and doing loads of self-discovery.  <newline>  <newline> But, on the other hand—I can’t ignore the nagging question of ‘what if it’s not ADHD?’  <newline>  <newline> What if I’m creating these issues in my head?  <newline>  <newline> I never liked doing dishes. What if when I was young, all those times my mom told me to, I just didn’t do them because I didn’t want to, not because I forgot? <newline>  <newline> What if I’m making everything up? My mom says she doesn’t think it is ADHD. She says I was too ‘emotionally mature’ at a young age. That with age I’ve just gotten lazy.  <newline>  <newline> What if she’s right? What if it’s just me? Then what the hell am I supposed to do?  <newline>  <newline> I can’t live like that. I can’t do normal things. I can’t even remember what I ate yesterday.  <newline>  <newline> If this is just how I am, I’m convinced it’ll never get better and I’ll never live a life, let alone the one I want to.  <newline>  <newline> Am I crazy?

722;133w4a5;(Vent [Undiagnosed]) Regret about reckless behaviour;"Hi everyone. I'm writing here for the first time because I really need to vent about something that happened a while ago. So I'm 23 and almost certain I have ADHD, I'm actually gonna have my first assessment this week after years of suspecting this about me. One of the symptoms that I get is every once in a while I start to do risky things that in the moment seem pretty low-consequence but that I deeply regret once the rush is gone, especially months later. This is mostly behaviour related to sexuality and the things themselves might be completely normal for someone else but I know that for my own personality it's something I'm doing out of being unstable in that moment. <newline>  <newline> So anyway I recently spent 6 months in a foreign country for exchange and I ended up meeting a man there that was in his late 30s. He worked at a shop that I stumbled upon by accident and I found him very attractive and struck conversation with him. The second time I went there I stayed a bit longer and he ended up following me back on instagram. At one point he even messaged me asking if I would like to meet sometime and because I am not totally delusional I still asked what his intentions were. He got a bit defensive but I explained myself and in the end I was the one that felt stupid. But I did feel attracted to him. At the time I felt really lonely because it was hard to make friends where I was and so I feel like the rush I got from this sense of male approval I got from interacting with him, even though he would drop really fucked up bits of information that I kind of just brushed off, made me keep coming back to him. He would randomly say stuff like ""my ex left me because I was an asshole"", ""i've been told i should go to therapy but i don't want to"". I also disclosed some personal information about myself that, although not inappropriate, was too much exposure for someone I didn't know.  <newline>  <newline> Even though he never directly hit on me it did feel like our conversations had some sort of flirty undertone to them and he would praise me in weird indirect ways as well. The last time I saw him I spent like two hours just sitting there but that time he finally did a good job at ruining the fantasy by making some comments that made it sound like I had been off-putting, contradicting what he said before about me. But in the moment I just went with it because I didn't know how to react and I think I was always aware that he was a shitty person and just a placeholder for this daydream I was making up. I myself said things to him that I regret. After this last interaction (which actually ended with him hugging me for some reason) I started feeling progressively more uncomfortable about him. Still I messaged him twice more, once to send him an album and another to ask about a book he posted on his story. He actually offered to lend it to me but I rejected it. We never spoke again after, never ended up meeting outside of the shop and I spent the past months really wanting to soft block him on instagram but I have been so scared that he would react because he seems like a pretty unstable person. <newline>  <newline> This whole thing makes me feel so stupid now that I'm back home and feel much calmer and self-aware. I feel really immature and naive about how I behaved. It's obvious now that he was just entertaining himself with an idiot young girl and even though I also wasn't taking it too seriously it's clear that there was a power dynamic going on, because he surely impacted me more than I impacted him. I finally soft blocked him today and I feel scared that he'll do something but he probably won't because he doesn't care. I'm just glad that I didn't fall in too deep in this and that we never ended up seeing each other otherwise, because it could have been way worse and more dangerous. <newline>  <newline> I feel really terrible about all of this. It's a mixture of shame and guilt and fear. I think a big part of it is disappointment about not taking good care of myself and how I am sometimes unable to stop myself from getting into situations that are obviously not good for me. <newline>  <newline> Thanks for reading this, please be gentle when replying because it's a very sensitive topic <newline>  <newline> TLDR: Was unstable, was talking to a man way older than me, now feel bad about having been immature and reckless <newline>  <newline> TLDRx2: fucked around and found out";gumelien;False;4;1.0;2023-04-30 16:18:37;/r/adhdwomen/comments/133w4a5/vent_undiagnosed_regret_about_reckless_behaviour/;adhdwomen

724;133t8tx;Using chatGPT to learn to write more concisely;Someone else posted about using chatGPT for ADHD the other day and a few people expressed interest in knowing the exact prompts I used when I said I was trying to use it to improve the brevity of my writing (it’s still very early days though!). By this I specifically mean that I am trying to learn to write more concisely, not just the act of feeding it wordy text to edit.  <newline>  <newline> This is the exact prompt I used: <newline>  <newline> ‘How can I improve my impactful communication and write with more brevity because everyone always makes fun of me for writing such long-winded responses due to my ADHD?’ <newline>  <newline> It gave me a few tips but so far the one I have found the most useful by miles is:  <newline>  <newline> Use an outline: Create an outline of the main points you want to make in your response. This can help you stay on track and avoid going off on tangents. <newline>  <newline> I then asked it ‘Can you help me with writing exercises to improve my brevity?’ And it gave me some exercises I could take away and do myself so I then clarified with ‘I meant can you help me with practice exercises here - like a sort of game, or a simulation, where you can then give me feedback on my writing as we go along from each task/exercise/simulation you’ve set me.’ <newline>  <newline> It then understood completely and has set me some imaged messages to send (I specified WhatsApp messages was where I wanted to focus first) like ‘a friend has asked you their opinion on a restaurant. Send a reply that…’ then given feedback on my responses.

I'm not even sure I'm upset anymore, probably I just need a Hug, but hate them, my go-to person for hugs isn't available And I just got in a stupid argument with him, Wich is making me so upset I actually hut myself, scratch the shit out of my legs (gonna have to Clio my nails again) and I just...I hate myself right now, because the stupid argument was about the intensions on a sentence, like, he was so excited talking to me about something he found to get food with some discount or coupons or something, and obviously my mind went to how that's a weird business to me, and how companies use those strategies and stuff, but it was like..so stupid (out of topic,I just started reading the post in my mind with that voice over from TikTok and is hilarious)  <newline>  <newline> The point is...why I make people upset when I'm trying to be nice and show interest on their respective things? I'm crying right now, again, because After talking to him about why hat I said was wrong he just pointed my line if thoughs and I see nothing wrong with it, it's exhausting, I'm so tired if this because it happens to me all the time and I really don't know how to Stop, because when I try to actively just show interest and don't say too much out of topic things, they think I'm not interested, even tho I make sure to make eye contact and the facial expressions, even make cuestions, and when I'm actually interested enough and confident u get excited and I go a little deeper in the topic they are talking about..they get mad at me <newline>  <newline> And I'm so confused and hurt because I've been feeling so alone and sad, and overwhelmed in general, I have some autistic traits, so I wonder if maybe that part of me is making my point if view less...idk, less something. <newline>  <newline> And the thing is, this person hates conflict, ans my constant nessesity for verbal confirmation of things it's like his cryptinite (he is neurodivergent too) si he gets stress if I talk too much and my anxiety goes wild if he doesn't answer me... We've been together 5 years and you know it's hard but we usually handle it a lot better, but I've been so out of control lately, and I know he try to listen and explain to me, the he got mad, I cried, he apologize and try again, I felt better because I needed the reassurance that he wasn't too mad, and felt horrible at the same time for not been able to actually understand and just....I feel tired, have to work, because yeah, I had to submit 16.000 words to my boss about something and U just kept saying I'll be awake to do it when everyone goes to bed"" but instead I just cried,felt bad and now I'm so sleepy and don't know if I would be able ti do it in the morning... <newline>  <newline> anyway, thanks for reading (if you actually did) if not I guess I just found a way to take this out if my chest";Zealousideal_Mix8795;False;2;1.0;2023-04-30 06:25:13;/r/adhdwomen/comments/133ho2v/im_having_a_meltdown_and_i_really_dont_know_where/;adhdwomen
727;133ebwo;im terrified of going for a diagnosis;What if I don't have it. I don't think I can deal with the shame of that, after convincing myself I do, and a big fat 'I told you so' from myself cuz while i think I have it a bigger part of me keeps denying it. But I hope its true. But that makes me feel like I'm just looking for an excuse. <newline>  <newline>  I went to the gp when I was 14 when I first found out about adhd and related to it. My parents didn't believe me but booked an appointment anyway. The gp said its just stress (right after I told him I can sit down at the dinner table for more than 2 minutes.)  <newline>    So then I was humiliated and doubted myself but also didn't believe him because I researxbes a lot and knew thats a stereotype and he shouldn't have deduced anything from it. He gave me forms to fill out my symptoms so I can get help for managing stress. I was so ready to fight for a diagnosis but was scared and kept putting off the forms until it was too late. Pretty sure I still have those forms somewhere.  <newline>  <newline>  I don't remember much of my childhood and can't ask my parents about symptoms I exhibited. I did, once. They both got mad that I'm trying to make something wrong with me and should just try harder. I can't ask them again. <newline>  <newline>  I have exams in 2 weeks. Fuck. Idk what to do. I've been to therapy for procrastination and mentioned adhd to the gp that referred me, he told me to talk to my therapist about it. My therapist believes that the uprise of technology and phones made everyone have lower attention spans, but she told me to go for a diagnosis for my own peace of mind (she can't diagnose anytbing, just there fkr the CBT- which did not work, btw).  <newline>  <newline> Also, I'm 18 now but my gp and NHS shit is still tied to my dad's number and account, so any appointment j make he will be notified of it. I don't want my parents to know about this. But I'm scared to ask him to remove me from his thingy (???idk what it even is) because what if he asks why. Ig it's valid that I'm an adult now and want to be jn full control of my stuff. Still scary. Or I can go to my gp place and ask them to change it. But idk if that works. Maybe I'll just ask him about it. I think I was working on something for this a few weeks ago but forgot to continue after they sent a login code to my phone which was upstairs since I swore it off for the night.

Something like “the woman had a great boyfriend but time passed and there is no longer a dopamine hit. But this person flirted with her and oh no, the dopamine is here again. See, kids, not regulating your dopamine will make you cheat.”  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I don’t know, it made me feel horrible and I can barely finish the first chapter. I know these are feelings and it’s not rational, I know my ADHD influences it, I know I can be impulsive and without the cheating ending it would be just an example of how dopamine needs a new source every time. And they didn’t mention ADHD yet. But I’m thinking, if an author was writing about periods as “oooh once a month this person will become hysterical, it happens to them, nothing they say has any value anymore and they all crave chocolate and affection like the emotional insane creatures they are” we would call it sexist even if it didn’t directly mention women. We know periods affect women and a woman will read this and feel like shit. Maybe there exists a woman that we could say fits this description, but she would obviously be the exception and not the rule, and a professional nonetheless cannot stigmatize a health issue to the people most likely to seek their help. A gynecologist associating periods with “hysteria” would clearly be mysoginistic. So, a psychiatrist associating ADHD indirectly with cheating would be… biased, mean, unhelpful, prejudiced?  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Am I a snowflake for thinking like this? I’ve never been the person to cancel others or to be in tune with the prejudiced twitter demon of the month, I truly believe these are misunderstandings and people can improve and change. I think that we should, however, ask for the right to be correctly represented in writing and media, as capable adults and not as hyperactige children or cheaters.

739;130ugzg;Dopamine Hits;Does anyone else have a mental ranking of what they might consider healthier vs unhealthier dopamine sources/hits?  <newline>  <newline> For example, I'm very addicted to my phone and spend a lot of time scrolling on social media because it gives me constant hits of dopamine. However, I've been noticing how much it's impacting my productivity and focus, and I haven't been 'living in the moment' as much as I'd like to (i.e. spending time with my mum & i'll be on my phone).  <newline>  <newline> In my mind, social media is a fairly neutral dopamine hit, depending on whether or not you're engaging in/following more positive or negative media. ANYWAY, I temporarily deactivated my twitter and instagram the other day to take a much-needed break, but I realized I've been seeking different dopamine hits elsewhere. This is where I get to my ranking thing: <newline>  <newline> I've been doing a LOT more online shopping, which isn't necessarily bad, but I'd rank it higher on the list of unhealthy dopamine hits simply because it negatively impacts my bank account lol. Also, snacking and eating more something I'm usually really good about, but I'm reaching for sugar more often than I'd like to be. I'd also rank this higher than social media on the unhealthy dopamine hit scale (eating, in general, is obviously not unhealthy, but I've been absolutely inhaling snacks, and it's a short-lived and unsustainable dopamine hit). Skin picking as well is a super annoying dopamine hit that leads to shame and feelings of guilt. I think I'd rather doom scroll twitter or instagram than zone out and annihilate my face in the mirror. Also, I've spent sooo much more time playing games on my phone, haha (neutral dopamine hit, almost better than social media, maybe -- except for the ones that encourage me to make in-app purchases, if I get invested enough, I will. I have, and I will. ugh). <newline>  <newline> I know I'll redownload instagram and twitter soon. A break is nice to have, no matter what.

Check the post!;" (First paragraph for my context) I've been diagnosed with ADD since I was 8, so I've been with this shit for almost 20 years. I always wanted to have a sustainable system to reference to. I tried the Bullet Journal, apps, post its... Too much effort. But now I've come with a quite interesting solution. <newline>  <newline> And the solution is... a **whiteboard**. Yes, a simple and pain whiteboard with an attachment for a pen (so you don't lose it and you have a place designed to store it). <newline>  <newline> **IS THIS FOR ME?** <newline>  <newline> \- Are you someone that works from home or spend a lot amount of time in a room working or studying? <newline>  <newline> \- Does your mind spontaneously think about something to do but you can't find the notebook you write things on or the app is far away because you want to avoid distractions, you get it and you forget about it and you get anxious about this and then you cry and regret having your phone in your hands because you just entered Instagram and spent 1 hour? (Just me? Okay... So...) <newline>  <newline> \- Do you have multiple systems and you don't know where to write this? <newline>  <newline> \- Do you have important appointments to attend this month/deadlines but you don't want to search these things in a notebook or app? <newline>  <newline> If you replied YES to any of these questions, consider having a Whiteboard. <newline>  <newline> **HOW DO** ***I*** **USE IT?** <newline>  <newline> Well, depending on the month, but what I have **every month** is a little **calendar** on the bottom. 7x5 calendar in the bottom left corner and then, in the right, I write my important appointments. <newline>  <newline> Also, I write down with a bullet in the beginning what is my **To-Do** and if it's for today or for what day. If it's for today, I just leave my dot followed by ""what do I need to do"". Copying a little bit the structure of the Bullet Journal key. <newline>  <newline> And in the **top** **of the whiteboard**, I write down some **Goals**. So, I'm writing in my computer, I look up and there I have my whiteboard with my goals for today or for the week or for the month or something. <newline>  <newline> I can also have different things written, such as **what to do if I have free time** (instead of spending time scrolling through TikTok) or **habits** to do during the week. <newline>  <newline> **TIPS** <newline>  <newline> When you complete a task, don't erase it. Do a tick in the bullet. Write it down into a Bullet Journal or anything sustainable to keep track of it at the end of the night or early in the morning, for example. For instance, what I do is at night, I write all I have in my whiteboard and that way I can see how many days a task has been there without actually being done. And at that moment, I erase the completed tasks. <newline>  <newline> It helped me a lot this simple system, I didn't see it before, I hope it can help you.

742;130c8p1;Single ADHD Ladies, Life is Rough but Rewarding: Cleaned out all the mouse poop!;"First off: I found something called ""[Warm Lines](https://warmline.org/warmdir.html#directory),"" which are like chill crisis lines, and maybe that's why I'm doing so much better today? I also called a few [prayer line](https://www.christianpure.com/learn/christian-prayer-hotlines)s because I genuinely felt like I was in a crisis last night, lots of RSD. I think talking to people, especially strangers in the middle of the night, really helped.  <newline>  <newline> I need to figure out what day of the month it is that I wake up and actually clean the fucking house... it's only one or two days I can get it together to clean. I swear, it's hormonal, ""nesting."" Like, one week after the new moon?  <newline>  <newline> What kinda freaks me out and intrigues me, is that I've lived here since December.  <newline>  <newline> At one point, maybe February? I noticed mice. I also thought I 'scrubbed,' the kitchen. Like, deep cleaned the kitchen, a couple of times. At one point, I duct taped off the dishwasher, because for some reason I just couldn't pull it out, I pulled out the drawer under the stove, where I knew they were coming out of, and somehow just ignored the fridge entirely. I found one of their nests in the fireplace and vacuumed it up. I often heard them or saw them out of the corner of my eye, and would get creeped out. I got a mouse trap from Amazon, and got like 11 of them, and live released them in the backyard, over my awful neighbor's fence. I swear, that's where they're coming from anyway. <newline>  <newline> They've gotten worse since then, but in my mind, they were just poking their heads out, squeaking loudly, and going back in their holes.  <newline>  <newline> Well... as I do, I let the kitchen go, despite my very, very best efforts not to. Dishes piled up, I didn't see any mouse droppings on the counter and I figured they were sticking to the floor.  <newline>  <newline> And... dot dot dot... they built a nest under my mixer and under my soda stream! ON THE COUNTER! Where I juice like an idiot every morning. Eeek!!!! <newline>  <newline> I pulled out the fridge today, mouse poop EVERYWHERE, I pulled out the stove, SAME thing. Now tell me girls, why didn't I ever pull out the fridge or the stove when I was so called, ""deep cleaning?!?!?!"" That isn't deep cleaning. I swear, there was probably 1/2 a pound of just pure, black mouse shit, pee and even a dead freaking mouse. Thank the Lord for my precious dog who stood by my side through it all, in case one ran out. I screamed at one point, and he heroically jumped right in. <newline>  <newline> So, I tackled it, canceled the chiro appointment even, with bleach, a scrubber, rubber gloves and a mask, and a toilet brush. Thank God for my little wet/dry shop vac. Godsend for ADHD kitchens.  <newline>  <newline> I shoved steel wool into the obvious cracks, talked to my dog A LOT, who stood by the whole time, and then got to the dishwasher. <newline>  <newline> I had actually asked a handyman to come over to pull it out, and another handy friend, and they never could. I think this group somehow motivated me to just not give up so easily, that and the MICE and the mouse shit all over the freaking KITCHEN where I am stupidly juicing and eating SOOO healthfully, surrounded by disease, Jesus Christ almighty help me.  <newline>  <newline> So, it took me twenty minutes of YouTubing, ""Why can't I pull out my dishwasher,"" in addition to calling my dad who was like, ""we'll call a handyman, or Kino,"" my sister's friend. I'm like, no, I will figure this out. Where does this determination come from and how to I access it more often? <newline>  <newline> It turns out, the dishwasher was hardwired into the wall. I had to cut the circuit breaker, use my iPhone camera to see behind the plate, a tiny screwdriver (Dollar Tree for $0.25 on sale!), lie on the floor at an impossibly awkward angle for way too long, with @ Ela\_Chi on TikTok ""plucking,"" negative energy from me all the while, and about two hours later, finally got the wires out, ordered the plug in kit from Amazon and got the mouse poop completely cleaned out from behind the dishwasher! Dopamine FTW. Plus, I got a foam board and taped it against the huge hole in the wall the mice have chunked out. God... finally! This is why I have no friends, and am single. I am so gross. I get it. I gross myself out. <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I had no idea I was going to spend the entire day doing this when I woke up... I thought I was maybe going to fold the sheets I've been wanting to fold since January, get a job, fix my iPhone or one of my three broken cars so I don't have to walk across the street with my food stamps to get awful groceries. I really, really want to get those sheets folded. But, maybe it was divine intervention because God knows I had zero conscious awareness to move the giant appliances, and no conscious desire to face that much scariness on my own. <newline>  <newline> I think I'm going to start journaling so I can at least try to figure out why some days I can do things, but I'll spend weeks just sitting on the couch watching the Sopranos stressing out and eating pumpkin seeds out of the bag. Even my writing all this out right now, that's dopamine working for me, instead of just zoning tf out with no energy to even comment on TikTok.

I find that in different stressful situations. I kind of just cut myself off from the rest of the worlds, and we had a lot of shared friends. I made my Instagram a little more private and blocked a few people making my Instagram only accessible to certain friends that I felt were my friends only not his. I feel bad now looking back and seeing that friends that were there for me, I can’t be there for them now because it feels like too much work to have friends. I feel like a traitor in a way, but I also remind myself to make myself feel better. That people are busy working. They have their own lives and I do too. I recently got divorced in November 2022, it’s been a lot of reevaluating. I’m definitely not the same person I was before. <newline>  <newline> I feel like those friends that I have remember me only as the person that I was when I was still with my ex-husband. I felt like I needed my friends more before, because I was so needy and unfulfilled when I was with my ex-husband. I was constantly clinging to my meme threads with my friends and social media. Different things make me happy now and I just can’t bother with the shame of just not being able to reach out and explain that I’m busy over that I needed a break because I’m such a wuss. I hate explaining myself and just wish I walked around with a sign, saying “living in her own fantasy world leave a message she may not get back to you, please don’t take it personally”. 🤣;Milk_n_hunny;False;1;1.0;2023-04-26 16:08:50;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12znmcc/too_scaredashamed_to_open_instagram/;adhdwomen

I have never been in a relationship (like never had any romantic interest before and now I’m 23) I have adhd even though I used to get crushes (which is so overwhelming and lasts for so long for me) I never knew of anyone had a crush or interest in me ( I usually never tell anyone I had a crush on them because I was and I still am SOOOO afraid of rejection, I did once and it backfired so badly I still feel it in my body after 4 years and that was the first and last time I did that) <newline>  <newline> So I was wondering is this true?

756;12xz953;Unsure if my adhd medication is working properly (dexedrine);Im 23 years old and just got diagnosed with adhd 2 weeks ago. I was prescribed 10mg dextroamphetamine sr (actavis) and im not sure if its working properly.  <newline>  <newline> I know its still early but i have a hard time realizing symptoms. before diagnosis i was in a constant state of exhaustion mentally and physically for about 2 years which it seems like was adhd burnout. Nothing seemed worth the effort and id spend most of my time watching tv and going on tiktok while i mostly zoned out cause it felt like it was all i had the energy for and if i tried to focus my thoughts would interrupt. I couldn't organize my thoughts and was bad at communicating what i was feeling/thinking and became emotionally overwhelmed very easily. I couldn't concentrate on anything that needed real brain power like reading or actively listening to people/movies/music, i would just drift into my thoughts and the thoughts were constant, rapid, and mostly negative. because of this i also had a terrible memory. im in school right now and found i couldn't stay focused on what i was learning for more than a few minutes before i drifted off without noticing. <newline>  <newline> Since i started taking the medication i feel my thoughts have slowed and become more clear and organized. ive noticed an improvement already in communicating my feelings and thoughts but i still seem to be distracted easily. The distraction is different though, before i would drift into my thoughts without noticing and stare out the window and zone out but now its a more self aware lack of focus. i find things popping into my head and getting distracted thinking about the topics leading to me researching them for hours when i know i should be doing school work. I used to feel like this most of the time when i was under 20, still easily distracted but in a different way. <newline>  <newline> I never thought i had adhd because it was extremely internal and didnt realize how much i shut down over the past couple years. Now that im taking the meds it seems my adhd has changed in some way but not gotten better? is this me coming out of burnout but still feeling the adhd as i did when i was younger? will it get better if i keep taking the meds or have the meds brought me out of burnout and i need a higher dose to address the adhd symptoms better? <newline>  <newline> i am also on prozac and trazodone i was thinking maybe the mixture isnt working? <newline>  <newline> is this normal or has anyone experienced this? i looked at side effects from the drug im on and i couldn't find anyone talking about something similar. any insight helps im realy guessing here as to why it doesnt feel like it work.;Puzzleheaded-Pass482;False;9;1.0;2023-04-24 22:40:14;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12xz953/unsure_if_my_adhd_medication_is_working_properly/;adhdwomen

761;12wsjbr;Tips for improving emotional self-regulation?;Hey gals, <newline>  <newline> I'm 21 F, and was diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) at 16. <newline>  <newline> I'm usually a very chill person, but if I'm sad or anxious, I sometimes explode. Pretty much my whole life I've been known to have intense crying fits and hyperventilate when I'm upset, which is sometimes over minor things. Sensory overload can cause this too, like if there's too much noise, flashing lights, or people in a room and I feel overwhelmed.  <newline>  <newline> I also find it SO HARD to stop ruminating on anxious thoughts without the help of someone else guiding me. I try counting while breathing, but my mind keeps worrying at the same time. It's like I have two trains of thought at once. YouTube guided meditations don't always help either because my mind blocks the sound out and focuses on the worry, or I feel lonely and wish I had someone with me in person. <newline>  <newline> I recently learned that these can be an ADHD traits.  <newline>  <newline> The main reason I want help with this is because I feel guilty about emotionally exploding in front of my boyfriend and bringing him down with me. I go to him when I feel sad or stressed, and sometimes he helps me to feel more calm, but other times talking to him amplifies my feelings.  <newline>  <newline> A few times, I've ended up screaming at him, which I promise I really didn't want to do, and I felt so guilty and ashamed afterwards! But in the moment as it's happening, I feel like I can't control the volume of my voice. All my bottled-up emotions come pouring out, and loud.  <newline>  <newline> It's happened when I'm already hyper-aroused and he wants to give me advice before letting me finish explaining what happened that made me feel upset. Or when I feel triggered by my childhood trauma or family issues and he tells me to get over it and live in the present moment. <newline>  <newline> He says that I need to stop having tantrums like a little girl and do something to fix my problems instead of come up with excuses why I can't. I don't know if those responses are valid or insensitive, but I really wish I had a better handle over my emotions because I'm embarrassed by the outbursts I have at my age!

762;12wnqdt;I worked on my article and didn't feel like dying;I'm so sorry I ended up writing too much. The most important paragraph is the second last one haha. <newline>  <newline> Background: I'm in my late twenties. I graduated medschool last year and I'm currently working in clinics and also writing my thesis. Actually to be more specific, I have been working on it for the last 5 years....... (Medschool is 6 yrs in my country). I have managed to write only one article, which isn't even publiced as the data is too old now and the article isn't interesting to journals anymore. So I'm in the process of updating it next fall. <newline>  <newline> I have _always_ felt this awful tingling, anxious, head-breaking feeling when I've tried to sit down to write. I cannot do it. My whole body refuses to do so and actually tortures me. Some days I could push through it to achieve hyperfocus but mostly couldn't. I have all these colleagues around me finishing their thesis' and I cannot even finish one damn article. I couldn't figure out why, just thought they had more will power compared to me. Fast forward 5 years and nothing changed. I felt so ashamed every time my prof contacted me asking whats up. <newline>  <newline> I started my worklife and noticed the same thing quite quickly: why is it so painful to do the simplest tasks but I love the hard cases? I truly enjoy my work but was on the verge of burn out, living from day to another. Moment to another. I was so damn tired. <newline>  <newline> Got evaluated because of instagram videos. God bless those ADHD influencers. Ofc I knew of ADHD since I work with patients but I hadn't even began to think I would have it. I always did good in school? Learned about masking and all, got an official diagnosis and it all just made sense! <newline>  <newline> Today marks the first month with Concerta. Today I tried to work on my article first time in months. I was sceptical because of my history and I _really_ didn't feel like doing it today but I had to because of deadlines (tomorrow lol). I opened the Word-file which has been a trigger for me before and felt NOTHING. No torturing. Just me, coffee mug and my laptop on the couch. I literally cried. I worked for an hour, ate lunch and worked AGAIN just like that. No extra effort. I was so efficent too, not checking my phone every 2 mins or so. <newline>  <newline> For the first time I feel like I can actually finish my thesis and it made my dopamine levels tingle from excitement.

766;12vkd97;Trouble finding the perfect tool for to-do lists? One simple analogical tool;"  <newline>  <newline> (First paragraph for my context) I've been diagnosed with ADD since I was 8, so I've been with this shit for almost 20 years. I always wanted to have a sustainable system to reference to. I tried the Bullet Journal, apps, post its... Too much effort. But now I've come with a quite interesting solution. <newline>  <newline> And the solution is... a **whiteboard**. Yes, a simple and pain whiteboard with an attachment for a pen (so you don't lose it and you have a place designed to store it). <newline>  <newline> **IS THIS FOR ME?** <newline>  <newline> \- Are you someone that works from home or spend a lot amount of time in a room working or studying? <newline>  <newline> \- Does your mind spontaneously think about something to do but you can't find the notebook you write things on or the app is far away because you want to avoid distractions, you get it and you forget about it and you get anxious about this and then you cry and regret having your phone in your hands because you just entered Instagram and spent 1 hour? (Just me? Okay... So...) <newline>  <newline> \- Do you have multiple systems and you don't know where to write this? <newline>  <newline> \- Do you have important appointments to attend this month/deadlines but you don't want to search these things in a notebook or app? <newline>  <newline> If you replied YES to any of these questions, consider having a Whiteboard. <newline>  <newline> **HOW DO** ***I*** **USE IT?** <newline>  <newline> Well, depending on the month, but what I have every month is a little **calendar** on the bottom. 7x5 calendar in the bottom left corner and then, in the right, I write my important appointments. <newline>  <newline> Also, I write down with a bullet in the beginning what is my **To-Do** and if it's for today or for what day. If it's for today, I just leave my dot followed by ""what do I need to do"". Copying a little bit the structure of the Bullet Journal key. <newline>  <newline> And in the **top** of the whiteboard, I write down some **Goals**. So, I'm writing in my computer, I look up and there I have my whiteboard with my goals for today or for the week or for the month or something. <newline>  <newline> I can also have different things written, such as **what to do if I have free time** (instead of spending time scrolling through TikTok) or habits to do during the week. <newline>  <newline> **TIPS** <newline>  <newline> When you complete a task, don't erase it. Do a tick in the bullet. Write it down into a Bullet Journal or anything sustainable to keep track of it at the end of the night or early in the morning, for example. For instance, what I do is at night, I write all I have in my whiteboard and that way I can see how many days a task has been there without actually being done. And at that moment, I erase the completed tasks. <newline>  <newline> It helped me a lot this simple system, I didn't see it before, I hope it can help you.

768;12v6joz;Birthday sadness;I don’t think I’m alone in these feelings. Today is my birthday, not a single friend has reached out to me even though I’ve left some *hints* on my business account and private story on Instagram. They’ve all seen them and not engaged. I had work this morning with colleagues I’m still fairly new too and had let them know before Easter that it’d be my birthday this week, and told them when I arrived that it was today and … nothing. They said they hoped I had a nice day, but I just feel so much RSD and a bit of a mental sadness spiral. <newline>  <newline> I put effort in for everyone else and just feel unappreciated and the annoying awkward link that people don’t want around. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Is it really a birthday without a midday sob?;Usernamesarehell;False;89;0.99;2023-04-22 13:52:15;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12v6joz/birthday_sadness/;adhdwomen
769;12uwzp5;Do you do these things?;A brief list of things I do / don’t do that seem to be in contrast with a lot of NT in my life and now idk if it’s a me thing or an ADHD thing: <newline>  <newline> 1. I don’t have favorites. I *really like* a lot of things in a category. I do not have a favorite book, movie, song, candy, actor, color, food, etc. I love so many of them EQUALLY. I think today I would be unable to pick between strawberries and mango. They are fully equally my favorite  <newline>  <newline> 2. I don’t get celebrity culture. I don’t remember half of their names, or if I know their name I don’t know their face. I don’t obsess over release dates or projects and I don’t follow them on social media. (I literally use the dailymail on snapchat every day to catch up with that kind of news so I don’t seem like an alien with my friends)  <newline>  <newline> 3. I have a hard time playing pretend with kids. I cannot get into it. I overthink every thing I say, and half the time they change the rules and then I get stressed. I had TWO imaginary friends during childhood and played with Playmobile well into middle school with my neighbor but now it’s gone.  <newline>  <newline> 4. I often connect the dots and ruin surprises without even trying to. It’s like my brain is automatically analyzing every possible option and giving me a nice print out of the most probable answer and then I end up ruining things for myself. ex.: partner got me a board game for christmas. I had zero hints, had literally forgotten the game existed AND that I had even mentioned it to him (we were doing long distance at the time so I didn’t even remember that I had seen the game WITH HIM for him to know I wanted it) I picked up the fully wrapped present and immediately knew what it was :/ <newline>  <newline> 5. Knowing what to do in new situations before everyone else because I’ve already taken in my surroundings. Ex.: getting off the subway in a new city and trying to get your bearings, I am already walking the right way when people are looking around <newline>  <newline> 6. being told I’m “mature” or “wise”because I give good advice but having no idea where I pulled it from and could never repeat it  <newline>  <newline> All of these I consider to be manifestations of my struggles with attention and focus at their root.  Very curious to see if anyone else relates! Feel free to add your own too! <newline>  <newline> edit: typos of course <newline>  <newline> ETA: all of this and then feeling frustrated when they’re are too “slow” to keep up so they get lost / feel stressed over being in an unfamiliar place and I’m just ready to cope by figuring it out because I have never had another option (can you tell I just got diagnosed 4 months ago hahahah);ale__locas;False;5;0.92;2023-04-22 06:20:55;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12uwzp5/do_you_do_these_things/;adhdwomen

771;12udrpg;Anyone else feel like they completely sabotaged their 20s?;In college I studied creative writing and received many accolades for my poetry. I was told by my poetry professors that I had a gift, I received scholarships and was asked to do readings. The issue was me, I sabotaged my opportunities out of fear and well...stressful life stuff like having to make rent money, dealing with shitty relationships. Anyway I am 33 now, and I have continued to write poetry privately... I am still facebook friends with my old professor who was my mentor but got mad at me for not showing up at a reading...  <newline>  <newline> I hated readings back then. I also just discovered I have ADHD so that explains a lot of my bridge-burning behaviors... I have no writer friends or poet friends so I'd figured I'd ask here but also I feel this is something fellow ADHDers can relate to… <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Anyways, has anyone revisited the talents that fell to wayside and found success ? Some of my peers, who weren't the strongest writers but could stomach the shameless self-promotion and seemed to enjoy the attention and were just driven people have gone on to be very successful poets... I spent my 20s working shitty jobs and living paycheck to paycheck. I am now in a more stable place and would like to get involved in poetry again but I'm afraid it's too late?  <newline>  <newline> 10 years have passed and I feel a little lame I am clinging onto my glory days. But poetry is really the only thing I'm good at and one of the few things I enjoy, I would like to be involved again and I would like to carve out some kind of life with it. I feel alot of regret and guilt for knocking all the opportunities that came my way. <newline>  <newline> ****UPDATE: Wow!! I was not expecting much of a response tbh. I want to reply to everyone directly but am running around ATM. But in mean time I just want to say THANKS for sharing your stories: I find that connecting and relating is often most healing when in moments of feeling regret/self doubt. I also loved all the advice and words of wisdom shared.  <newline>  <newline> Also I wanna make clear even though I seem to think otherwise in my OG post- I do at my core believe it is never too late and that age is just a number. I’ve always been ageist against myself 😂but don’t think twice when I meet people who pursue later in life dreams. I think it’s awesome and I agree especially as women/AFAB we can struggle / beat ourselves up over this nonexistent and ageist deadline ..  <newline>  <newline> Also wanna clear up: I think my term “shitty” job could come off as classist and I wanna say that I believe all jobs are shitty. I worked an office job, a public school job, barista jobs, landscaping jobs.. I meant financially shitty but not social status shitty. I feel the need to clarify because I myself am triggered by that kind of language lol.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> It  seems like for ADHDers especially the 20s are an absolute experimental shit show 😂 and I do think our experiences, fuck ups, and experiments add another layer of depth and complexity to our already dynamic and unique selves!  I agree with the sentiment that more lived experiences can create the best art . <newline>  <newline> I had a major internal shift this past week and this thread has totally validated it: I plan to prioritize what I enjoy (poetry) and work a job that pays the bills but does not take over my life . ( I worked with middle schoolers for 4 years and while I loved those crazy little assholes it completely sucked the life out me and I just did not have any creative energy, all I could think about was the kid trauma around me. I took a lot of naps, drank alot on the weekends and couch potatoed to cope with the stress.) I know and am totally fine with poetry not being a money maker at all but I want to reconfigure my life so I can shift my focus back to writing! <newline>  <newline> These words of encouragement and nods of commiseration have absolutely lit a fire under my ass while also calming my “what if” anxieties.

772;12u3bwy;Feeling overwhelmed by ADHD evaluation/diagnosis process;Everything is just kind of all over the place, you know? Some therapists believe in it, some don’t. Some therapists understand how it shows up in women, masking, all that, some don’t.  <newline>  <newline> I know ADHD is super undiagnosed in women, but I also know ADHD is getting a lot of attention on social media right now, and it could be easy to self diagnose even if your struggles stem from something else. Or maybe your struggles are completely “normal” for humans, whatever normal means.  <newline>  <newline> I made an appointment for an ADHD evaluation as I think it is highly likely I have it. I didn’t come to this conclusion from TikTok. I don’t even use TIkTok lol. But my husband, who was diagnosed with ADHD as a teen and has recently taken an “interest” in it again as he’s had some work trouble, is the one that pointed out that I probably have ADHD.  <newline>  <newline> And after doing some research, yeah, I feel like it makes sense. I feel like it would explain a lot of my struggles, and now I also think my mom also had it, like really badly, and was why she turned to alcoholism, to unknowingly self medicate.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, idk, so I made my evaluation appointment. But reading stories on Reddit about some people’s struggles to get a diagnosis, how some therapists really just don’t get it, etc. I really WANT to just accept whatever the evaluation tells me. I’m trying to ready myself to just accept the decision. Like no, I’m not a doctor. But how will I know that the right call has been made? What if my evaluator is one of those “oh you got good grades you’re fine” people?  <newline>  <newline> My evaluation isn’t until the end of May and I am just so back in forth in my brain you have it / you don’t have it. I’m thinking of going back to my regular therapist until then (I stopped seeing her when she went on maternity leave) but I’m afraid that she won’t get it and will make me more nervous. She didn’t mention ADHD in the 1.5years I talked to her. <newline>  <newline> And idk this community is like 99% supportive and awesome. And then there are a few comments here and there like “why do you want ADHD? Why is this so trendy?” Or “you can’t have had ADHD because you didn’t suffer enough.” And we all know how it is. That little bit of rejection is enough to be like, oh wow I don’t belong here. I probably don’t have ADHD. I’m probably making it up.  <newline>  <newline> And no, I don’t WANT ADHD. But if I have it… wouldn’t it be fucking nice to know?  <newline>  <newline> Ugh sorry this post is all over the place I just needed to get some thoughts out I guess.;Goosedog_honk;False;8;1.0;2023-04-21 14:22:44;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12u3bwy/feeling_overwhelmed_by_adhd_evaluationdiagnosis/;adhdwomen

775;12t6gce;To be thankful for Executive Dysfunction/Task Paralysis;I live in an area (Brooklyn, NYC) where they don't aggressively ticket cars for street cleaning, which is just a little bit of mercy I'm thankful for on the days I forget to move my car.  <newline> Today I had something get me out of bed & move my car before it started and I got back right as the street cleaning was going to start (11:30am-1pm) and parked my car on non-street cleaning side BUT in front of a hydrant. Cue DoomScrolling through Instagram/Reddit/etc just sitting in my car FOR AN HOUR and as soon as I realize how much time has passed, here comes the ticket officer dolling out fines for all the cars that didn't move for street cleaning. He glances at my car in front of the hydrant, makes eye contact with me as I do the half-smile-look-of-acknowledgment, and he continues to ticket all the other cars. For all the times I've hated myself for wasting time in the DoomScroll/Executive Dysfunction/Task paralysis rabbit hole, it saved me from a parking ticket thats well over $100. And for that, I can be thankful.  <newline>  <newline> Oh, and I'm posting this STILL SITTING IN THE CAR and the street sweeper hasn't come by yet.;yubaba-;False;2;0.95;2023-04-20 16:11:33;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12t6gce/to_be_thankful_for_executive_dysfunctiontask/;adhdwomen
776;12s65tx;The idea of journaling appeals to me but the setup takes longer than my attention spans desire;I wanted to use my ipad and put it to more use.

777;12rq4fd;Stuck;I'm so fucking frustrated with myself, I don't know what to do so I figured I'd get it out of my head in the hopes that this helps. <newline>  <newline> I'm working from home today. By now I've figured out strategies, tools etc. to help me work from home effectively. I actually prefer it to working in the office, because I get fewer interruptions and I'm able to plan my day according to my energy, flow etc. <newline>  <newline> But not today. Since 8:45 am I have: <newline>  <newline> * Made my to-do list for today <newline> * Spent 45min playing a mobile game <newline> * Watched Youtube for about an hour while having coffee with my husband <newline> * Did 1 work task off my to-do list (approximately 30min) <newline> * Taken 3 cups and 2 glasses out of the dishwasher and put them into the cupboard <newline> * Spent about an hour playing 2048 <newline>  <newline> Work is currently not that busy, meaning this is the perfect time to empty my inbox (I came back from holiday last week so I've got quite the backlog). I have a to-do list a mile long with stuff that needs doing. It might not be urgent now, but it will be soon enough. I know that I should just tackle some simple tasks to get me going. I slept well, I've taken my medication, I'm even managing to drink enough and although I forgot to have breakfast I did just have lunch. <newline>  <newline> I absolutely hate days like this. This is my most hated part of ADHD. It feels like I'm trapped inside my own brain/body. Rationally, I know what I have to do. I know the tricks. I have my strategies, which I know work. But it's like my body is possessed by a spiteful little devil going 'nah-ah! We're not doing any of that! We're just going to sit here!' I feel like I'm screaming inside my head and rattling my cage, but on the outside nothing is happening. <newline>  <newline> Also, I've 'missed' (ignored) several phonecalls and I have about 150 unread e-mails, which give me anxiety. What if there's something important that I've missed? What if people are getting angry because they think I'm ignoring them/not working (they would be right)? What if, what if, what if. <newline>  <newline> And again, rationally and from experience, I know that there are no problems. I've scanned my mailbox for urgent stuff, so there's no 'fires' I've missed. I largely know who the phonecalls are from and what they're about. I've had days/weeks before where I wasn't really reachable by phone, and it's never been an issue for any of my colleagues before. Everybody is busy with their own stuff. <newline>  <newline> But my brain just won't shut up about it. Making me anxious, which makes it EVEN HARDER to get any work done because I flee from the possibility of confrontation/negative feedback. <newline>  <newline> AAARGH! <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I'm going to try to process e-mails for 1 pomodoro now.

782;12p9qva;Does the pomodoro technique work for you?;ETA: I’m gonna make a quick (I hope) summary here, because this post got way more responses than I thought it would and I’m not gonna be able to answer everyone of you, but I have read most responses! In short, original pomodoro is a method where you alternate 4 rounds of 25 min work, 5 min break followed by 20-30 minute break before starting a new cycle.  <newline>  <newline> It’s a mixed bag, although for most people it does help them get started on tasks. People who do find it useful, usually alter the time, either to a shorter limit just for getting started, or a longer limit to not break the focus (eg. 10-5 or 50-10). Shorter times are usually used for tasks like cleaning, longer periods for things that require prolonged focus. People often ignore the alarms when they’ve started. Body doubling, seeking support from others, competition, discord pomodoro groups etc. help some people to stay committed. Very few people actually manage a full pomodoro cycle if they don’t adjust it to their own needs. Tips people are also giving for not turning you break into stopping are to not use your phone in breaks or giving yourself a task with a clear limit during the break (eg. Fold 15 pieces of laundry).  <newline>  <newline> Thanks everyone for all the responses. I probably missed some of your tips and experiences but I hope I did manage to catch the more general experiences people are having! If there’s anything you want me to add, let me know!  <newline>  <newline> Original question: <newline>  <newline> I looked in to the pomodoro technique and read that it would be great for people with ADHD. What are your personal experiences with it? Does it work or not? And why does or doesn’t it work for you?  <newline>  <newline> I have a feeling that the starting and stopping several times might be difficult, because sometimes it takes a while to get into a workflow only to disrupt it after 25 minutes and having to start all over again. If it didn’t work for you, do you have any other techniques that do work for you?  <newline>  <newline> Asking for a friend who needs to finish a report in a pretty short time but is stuck researching the fucking pomodoro technique! <newline>  <newline> (It’s me, I’m the friend.

783;12olg37;A day in the life (ADHD version);To do: <newline> Laundry. <newline> Pick up groceries from Sam’s Club. <newline> Sweep deck. <newline> Hit “submit” on taxes. <newline>  <newline> What actually happened/is happening: <newline> Put laundry in.  <newline> Go thru an old purse looking for Discover card. Not there, but nifty clean moisturizer jar that I think I saved to keep change in my car. Or did I take change to school for a coin war? Still, I need change in my car - I didn’t have any change the last time I had to feed a meter.

Put coins in center console. Hey! I didn’t know I had a USB to USB-C charger! Cool. Why do I have receipts from 2 years ago? Oooh! That’s the bubble wand from E’s wedding! 💕 Oh. Ick. It all leaked out. Yuck. The coins (apparently I’ve saved some coins since last May) are all sticky and gross. Ok. I need to take this whole tray in and wash it. But I gotta get a move on.  <newline> Stop at the hardware store on the way. Not in the plan but I saw a guy on TikTok show how great WD40 is for cleaning screens.

786;12nmdh1;Any advice for trying to get off TikTok/other sites similar?;I’ve grown up with TikTok and have had an account on either musically or TikTok since my early teens. I’ve tried to quit so many times but it really just scratches the itch in my brain. Constant scrolling fills the void of me want to move all the time and the algorithm is extremely addictive. Not to mention the FOMO I get whenever I take a break and miss trends/memes etc. I’ve so far managed to delete my personal account with my friends following so I know it won’t be a problem if I quit, I just need to find the motivation.

787;12maj2d;ADHD and learning styles;Hello all! <newline>  <newline> So I was diagnosed w/ ADHD \~ 1.5 years ago and have been on medication and in therapy, actively working to improve and break habits, etc. However I went back to grad school and tried to succeed w/o accommodations \[bad idea on my end when I have used them in the past\]. I admit I had a hard time asking for help at school and ended up having to take a LOA for this year and plan on returning Fall 2023. I have all my paperwork in order for accommodations now too.  <newline>  <newline> But I am trying to study for the MCAT in a way that works for me since the past times I have attempted the MCAT, my studying/style of learning was subpar and not good, so bad results. So I am trying to change this and figured this is a good time to also set myself for the future and studying in grad school.  <newline>  <newline> My problem I have become aware of now is that when I need to learn something and understand it, I cannot listen to someone explain it or talk about on a YouTube video. Like I have to mute the tutorial and have subtitles on, read everything, and walk myself through the tutorial to solve the problem. This is new for me- like it never occurred to me to do this in the past. I think the noises of the world in general and then the audio of the tutorial are distracting me but I'm not sure. When I have been in lectures in the past year before my LOA, I found lectures not helpful and distracting then I would end up having to go to the recorded lecture video for that day and redo everything at my speed to understand it. I was so tempted to skip lectures b/c of this and the fact it wasn't helpful to be there in person. \[I know there could also a small chance that the lecturer wasn't great and could effect this too, but I feel like it was more of a me problem more than anything.\]  <newline>  <newline> Like is this normal- having to have everything quiet and muted in order for me to process and understand everything? How am I supposed to attend lectures when the fact the lecturer just talking distracts me. Am I supposed to wear headphones and basically noise cancel the lecturer to a more comfortable level for myself? Is this a specific learning style? Is anyone else like this? Should I ask about some kind of accommodations for this \[I have accommodations for extra time on exams/quizzes type of thing\]?  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Thankssss!!!! <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> \[hopefully this makes sense- I'm having a difficult time putting this into words/ sentences that make sense\];pppppaigeeee_13;False;1;1.0;2023-04-14 19:38:19;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12maj2d/adhd_and_learning_styles/;adhdwomen

797;12ipqmn;"ADHD books / resources not full of latent pity and ""go get 'em tiger"" condescension?";"I want to learn psychological facts and impacts of ADHD, but every book I listen to has *so* much ""you're so different, it's so hard, but you've got this!"" I have a rant about that below, but, let's get to want I want first: <newline>  <newline> Books or information that provides psychological information, facts, and impact including a logical and unemotional deep-dive into (i) the types of ADHD, (ii) how executive disfunction manifests, (iii) emotional deregulation (all of it), (iv) why I have nearly perfect recall of an inane conversation about my dad's potatoe preference from a year ago, but also, out of sight, out of mind is real, (v) studies on the brain and body including: imaging, double blind, placebo, etc., (vi) why coping mechanisms that are complete opposites (caffeine and alcohol) seem to work the same on an ADHD brain . . .  <newline>  <newline> Rant:  <newline>  <newline> I feel like the books and audio compare ADHD to a perfect person without any mental or physical issues that has (somehow) escaped all forms of trauma and does not suffer from a socio-economic bar. Yes, I understand most people have many of the above issues *and* ADHD, but the books don't approach it like that. The books are mostly, ""You're impeded in life, make up a *shitty* metaphor."" Rosier, Tamara, Your Brains Not Broken: Chapter 1. (There are other books, podcasts, youtube videos, etc.: this book is just the flavor of the week) <newline>  <newline> Books also irritate me because most Western cultures celebrate individuality, but then all the books seem to be ""you're different, and that's sad."" Yes, I'm messy -and? It's my life. Isn't being different good? I don't actually see messy as bad (with caveats), so why is this always topic 1 with the books?!  <newline>  <newline> As for being different - seeing the world differently - that is an immeasurably VALUABLE trait. Why is this framed as a defect?  <newline>  <newline> As to the objectively bad:  <newline>  <newline> Yes, I'm irritable - why? Give me something deeper than, ""Your brain doesn't regulate input teehee."" Help me understand it, help me understand solutions.  Hell, maybe if I understand it, I can form the best path and best solutions for my life and myself. <newline>  <newline> Yes, I'm impulsive: My husband and I almost had tickets to Korea this morning.  (Obviously, *South* Korea, I'm over that joke).  But, instead of providing me with conclusions about what the symptoms are, tell me *why*. Or, a theory as to why. I'll take competing theories.  But, ""people think you're dumb because you're impuslive,"" is not acceptable (or good science, or good psychology).  <newline>  <newline> And for the love of God, stop comparing me to an amputee or a race participant distracted by a daisy.. Yes, I understand the importance of creating an analogy that's brings the hidden issues of the mind to the forefront of perception, but neither if these are appropriate. One is so different from the feeling of ADHD that the comparison does not make sense, and the other trivializes what is going on. These things don't convey anything about ADHD and are just empty rhetoric that may sound cute but are completely worthless. <newline>  <newline>  If someone without ADHD wants the ""ADHD Experience"" I am more than happy to dress them in some itchy clothes, put them in a 400 square foor room with no ceiling, 100 Harleys in the front yeard, 22 jets overhead, a baby crying, and Bob from accounting talking about typos in the subject line of a transmission email.  <newline>  <newline> Huh, maybe I do like metaphors after all.";Sorry-Lemon8198;False;28;0.97;2023-04-11 16:47:40;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12ipqmn/adhd_books_resources_not_full_of_latent_pity_and/;adhdwomen
798;12iezd2;hyper fixation and limerence;Hey, new to this sub! My background is that I pushed for an ADD assessment 10+ years ago when I was severely depressed and in talking therapy. Although the psychiatrist who did the assessment said I have a lot of symptoms and I could very well have ADD (and offered me medication that I didn't want), nothing else happened. I just got therapy for my depression and that's it. <newline>  <newline> I know I'm 'neurospicy' and a lot of my friends are too, some diagnosed, some not. And I never really thought much of it. <newline>  <newline> Recently, I saw a video on TikTok of someone talking about the ADHD and limerence connection, and to be honest, I never put two and two together. I suffered (that's the only suitable term here) from hyper fixating on a person accompanied by constant limerence I think since I was 5 years old, and it is seriously driving me insane and making me unhappy. Often these are romantic interests or close male friends, and when I was little even fictional characters. <newline>  <newline> I'm a little distraught to find out this could be connected to ADD, because I always thought there was just something wrong with me. Probably something from past trauma and being emotionally neglected, so having fantasies about being loved and accepted kind of made sense to me. <newline>  <newline> Does anyone else have experience with this? Can it be 'fixed'? I want to not fixate on someone 24/7 if that's possible, which may help me have a normal romantic relationship with someone who I'm actually compatible with. Please please share me your stories if you have any advice. <newline>  <newline> I'm thinking of approaching either my GP or a psychiatrist about this and asking for help, but I'm afraid I won't be taken seriously just like in the past. <newline>  <newline> TLDR: does anyone else have experience with limerence and hyper fixation on a person and did you find ways to deal with it? It is completely taken over my life.;Previous_Original_30;False;4;1.0;2023-04-11 10:03:13;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12iezd2/hyper_fixation_and_limerence/;adhdwomen

801;12i7i8j;Hyperfixations or the lack thereof?;So I've been watching a whole load of YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels about people with ADHD and their hyperfixations: like what the newest one was, what they learned, etc. But I can't remember the last time I was hyperfixated on anything. The closest thing I can remember is a few years ago when I took knitting classes. And of all the hyperfixations I've had hobby wise I still do them! It's not like I picked them up, spent a shit ton of money I don't have and time and energy learning or doing something then 3 months later say I'm bored and move onto the next thing. Maybe not as heavily as I did before but I still knit, crochet, bead, cook, bake, do photography and garden. Like I no longer hyperfixate on anything but conversely I've also lost a lot of enthusiasm for the things I used to do. It's been months since I picked up a camera and I still travel with a crochet project but that's cause I tend to pick at myself if my hands aren't occupied and fidgets aren't always polite (side note: what the actual hell is up with that?)

804;12g6gfg;I don't like to watch;"I really don't enjoy watching things, and I'm feeling incredibly alone and alienated by this. People base their personalities around what they watch. By ""what they watch"", I mean sports, TV, anime, movies, Tiktoks, and YouTube. I count scrolling through social media, reading books, and playing videogames in this, too. I hate getting asked my favorite movie: I don't have one. This weirds people out and disappoints them. <newline>  <newline> When I watch something fictional, my brain doesn't register it as important, so almost none of it sticks, even on the occasions where I'm able to enjoy it a bit. I think part of this has to do with the complexity of stories and characters. Learning about my hobbies, things stay the same. For example, ""ferns enjoy humidity"", that doesn't change. However, characters and stories don't work that way. I'm supposed to somehow take in and compile all the tiny details simultaneously, deducing character traits from this, while also remembering the order of events in a story, as well as their relation to each character. That's insane for me to imagine succeeding at, and I definitely lack the interest and dedication to even try. I loved Chainsaw Man, but I would never be able to write a fanfiction, and I have no idea which characters died or how it happened. Even if I remember enjoying a piece of media like this, it's nothing I can hold.  <newline>  <newline> I don't entirely mind people talking about the media they like, but I really don't like being sent Tiktoks and things like that. It's loud and annoying. I like to consume content with a set goal in mind, like a tutorial video for a project I want to work on.  <newline>  <newline> I recognize that most media exists as parasocial or vicarious ways of experiencing the world. Knowing this, it loses much of its appeal. I want real things that I can hold and connect with. I want real friends instead of watching Friends on TV. I want to garden instead of clicking buttons to watch a pixelated character garden in Stardew Valley.  <newline>  <newline> Dating apps, in particular, have become Hell because of this. So many bios are just a list of what people watch. So many interactions are just interrogations about the media I'm supposed to enjoy. The people who aren't into media feel very mature compared to me, just simple functional humans that don't communicate in any way similar to how I do. They don't have similar experiences to me, similar ways of thinking. The people who have lived similarly to how I have seem to be the ones who retreat into fantasy media the most. They're the ones who go hide away where I can't even connect with them.

813;12e88vc;I keep ghosting my family.;"I sort of feel like my life is spiraling out of control right now, it's always been pretty bad but now it feels worse. <newline>  <newline> My parents were the ones who got my diagnosis when I was a teen but they wanted to sweep it under the rug and they got angry at me for just not being normal. They've never understood me and they still don't. Recently my mom was diagnosed with GAD(which I also have and was treated like shit for) and she's been blowing up my phone with all this mental health stuff that works for her and must be universal. I feel overwhelmed and exhausted with this. She finally acknowledges that mental health is important, just not mine. I'm still held to these seemingly simple tasks that I can't ever live up to. <newline>  <newline> My house is never clean enough. I'm not social enough during visits. I don't show enough interest in whatever they're doing. And best of all: I don't call enough. <newline>  <newline> I find phone calls and texts almost paralyzing. If I see a text, or worse, a pile up of missed calls and messages, I freeze up and put it off for later. Then it becomes a week later because I forgot and I'm racked with insane guilt and put it off for ""just a minute"" only for another week to go by. I usually get a lot of passive aggressive messages ""I guess you don't care about your family anymore"" and a lot of emojis. The constant flood of guilt makes me put it off again and once again, I forget.  <newline>  <newline> My mom will leave me a good 30-40 facebook messages a day and sandwich something important I need to know about in between shitty minion memes. It makes me want to scream. I can't process this. I can't dig through layers of this crap to find what I need and write it down. <newline>  <newline> I found out my grandmother died last month because the info was sandwiched between memes and articles she found about her diagnosis. The news shattered me. I'm still numb. <newline>  <newline> And the icing on the cake is, my grandmother and I used to be close, but my father told her I don't care anymore, so the last conversation I had with her before she died is how shitty I am to my parents and god would be disappointed in me. <newline>  <newline> I feel like a massive failure right now and I still can't pick up the phone. I'm hurt and angry, and disappointed in myself. If anyone out there deals with this, I would love any advice. It feels like all my family hears is excuses and they're just tired of it, tired of me, and they don't understand ADHD in the slightest so every fuckup I make is a personal attack.";Miss_Milk_Tea;False;4;1.0;2023-04-07 03:29:14;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12e88vc/i_keep_ghosting_my_family/;adhdwomen

818;12c92s0;Undiagnosed friend adopted my ADHD diagnosis as her own;"So, I'm wondering if this situation might feel familiar to some of you and I'd love some thoughts and outside perspective.  <newline>  <newline> For background: I received an adhd diagnosis about 2 years ago now at age 30. <newline>  <newline> A close friend of mine, who I've always talked about mental health with because we've had some similar experiences battling anxiety and depression, very shortly after basically adopted my diagnosis as her own.  <newline>  <newline> Which, to be clear, could be accurate. I'm in no way qualified to say she doesn't have adhd, any more than I am to say she does.  <newline>  <newline> But we  have different experiences and symptoms, despite some overlap, and she also doesn't have a psych/counselor of any sort to bounce this off of and has never gone to one in the past with regards to managing her pretty severe anxiety. This self diagnosis is all based on us having some commonalities and what she has consumed from social media, and the way she talks about and treats it has big ""making I'm-so-ocd jokes because you like to alphabetize your bookshelf and have all your clothes hangers face the same way"" energy. <newline>  <newline> She's a big tiktok user, and has watched I don't even know how many hours of adhd videos. Which is not a good resource, as a whole. While there are good bits and pieces to be found there's a tonne of vague, inaccurate, and straight up nonsense information being shared. And even the good stuff is largely individual people sharing their own personal experiences, which can be a helpful resource but shouldn't be used to point to a definitive diagnosis in a ""well, I related to this video about having trouble starting tasks, therefore I definitely have adhd, case closed"" kind of way. Which is essentially the approach she's taken. Little introspection, no consideration of the overlap between many adhd and anxiety symptoms/struggles, no input from health care practicioners, etc.  <newline>  <newline> To be clear: I don't mean to be dismissive of the concept of self diagnosis, but I do think that it requires more than social media consumption. <newline>  <newline> Still, if that were all I could let it go as not my business. But she keeps talking about adhd to me like we're both in this together. Except her version of talking about it is stuff like constantly making jokes about her short attention span (which was never a thing before she decided she had adhd), using the term hyperfixation any time she's mildly interested in anything, talking about having common adhd traits like not reacting to caffeine even though the entire decade plus I've known her she's avoided coffee because of how sensitive she is to it (which doesn't rule out adhd but is an example of how she's overwriting her own experiences to fit an adhd diagnosis instead of seeing if an adhd diagnosis fits her experiences), and laughing at how omg she can't have a conversation without changing subjects. As if everyone else is out here having perfectly linear, organized conversations even when they're just shooting the shit with friends. Which is a good example of her lack of nuance in understanding that a lot of adhd symptoms are something many people may do or experience to an extent, but it's about the severity and frequency and impact these things have on your life.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, this has been really challenging and honestly hurtful to deal with, and I'd love to know if anyone else has been in a similar pickle. <newline>  <newline> I want to be supportive if she does genuinely feel she might have adhd, but I'm not here for her memefied interpration of it and total lack of interest in engaging with it beyond the superficial. It really feels like she's picked it up as a fun new personality accessory, and that's hard to deal with while I'm trying to sort through the way this diagnosis has kind of turned my life and identity inside out and upside down, and the catharsis and grief that come hand in hand with being handed a new piece of your identity well into adulthood. My diagnosis has been massively helpful and affirming, but it's also been complicated and confronting.  <newline>  <newline> Basically: I hate all the harmful stereotypes about how adhd is overdiagnosed now, I hate unnuanced vilification of social media, and I hate dismissing the concept of self diagnosis. Buuuut, on the other hand, it's hard not to feel like people like this truly are just hopping on the bandwagon because a tonne of 19 yo tiktokers are talking about adhd like the hottest new fad. And I don't know how to deal with this in a fair and sensitive way with an incredibly close friend who absolutely does have mental health struggles, whether they're related to adhd or not.  <newline>  <newline> It sucks and I needed to vent about it, and congrats and thank you to anyone who actually read all of this lol.";bootsorheartss;False;47;1.0;2023-04-05 05:02:42;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12c92s0/undiagnosed_friend_adopted_my_adhd_diagnosis_as/;adhdwomen

826;12an6pu;Might be a long shot but anyone live in Orange County, CA?;I’m an elder millennial mom and professional who feels IMMENSELY alone. I know that several people in my family have cognitive differences but I feel that being in denial about differences holds us back and I’m so tired of that. They want me to stop focusing on our issues and just try harder to pretend to have it all together. I want a group that I might be able to meet up with one day a month where I don’t have to mask, lie about how insane getting ready to go to the meeting was, or try to perform professional decorum to appear like I’m not the totally ADHD + Autistic person that I am. My best friends (for 20+ years) are also neurodivergent as are their parents. But they don’t have a diagnosis nor do they think they are. If it walks like a duck, acts like a duck, and has been comfortably my best friend for decades= they’re neurodivergent for sure. But I realized recently that it’s so nice being in this group AND having others to learn from who are self-aware or diagnosed and I’d like to meet up. Perhaps starting a Facebook group because the local CHADD is mostly zoom and I do enough of that at work. It could be something simple like meeting up at a coffee shop or getting together at a hotel by the beach like the Ritz in Monarch beach for a $15 coffee? But I just remembered I can’t drink coffee on days I take medicine. But my point is we could find a place to hang out and be IRL supportive and authentically ourselves.

829;12a7x8h;Don’t you hate it when a hyper fixation ruins a routine?;I have been been very proud of myself over the past month for sticking to a daily skin routine. I’ve never had a consistent with one, so I decided to invest in a basic kit (cleanser, face moisturiser, eye cream etc) and a few additional things like retinol, night cream and body moisturiser. I made sure everything was super easy and lazy so my brain wouldn’t fight it (most of the products have pumps or droppers so I don’t use too much and can set myself rules, like 2 drops of this, 1 pump of that, like a recipe to follow) and my skin has been looking great. <newline>  <newline> I’ve been dedicated to a sleep routine for months now as well, I read a “boring” book in the sense there’s no plot or characters, so it’s basically been self-help books like Atomic Habits or Your Head is a Houseboat. I put a 30 min sunset timer on my alarm and by the time it’s too dark to read, my eyes are tired so I close the book and the end of the paragraph and go to sleep. <newline>  <newline> Cue a new book that has been popping up on all the book instagrams I follow. A Court of Thorns and Roses. I decide that I needed a dumb read to break up the self help cycle and I just assumed it was a dumb fairy romance novel. I read it in 3 days, and I wasn’t completely sold on it and was able to put it down after my sunset timer. I still decided to buy the rest under the assumption they were gonna be as cringey, so I kept the receipt just in case. <newline>  <newline> Oh my god. I’m now into Book 3 and it has now taken over all my brain power. Night time skin routine? Gone. Bedtime routine? I went to bed at 1AM instead of 10:30PM because I didn’t notice how much time had gone by after cancelling my sunset alarm because I was “at a good part”. The list of chores? I manage maybe one thing before deciding I needed a reading break and then never finished my chore list. I can barely function at work because my brain is twitching like crazy and just wants to read. <newline>  <newline> I’m so angry, I’ve built these routines and I have worked so hard to keep them and my brain has decided to go “No, read the fairy novel. Nothing else matters.” And I can’t turn it off. So now I don’t have groceries for dinner, my bathroom is a mess, my washing remains in a pile, my skin is already dehydrated so I’m a flakey lizard with cracked lips again. <newline>   <newline> And that’s my vent for the day.

830;12a20qj;Remote work, quitting my job, wtf is wrong with me;I got a job, a CAREER type job about a year ago. LinkedIn people would be impressed by the acronyms that relate to the position and job.  Pay was amazing, I negotiated a late start to factor in the morning scaries, and it was fully remote so I didn't even have to put pants on - and I was already working a remote job so I thought I had hit the jackpot. No masking at the office, no sensory overload from commuting, no office kitchen politics?  This job is heaven.  I am thriving in parts of the role, learning heaps but there's something inside me saying 'this is wrong, you shouldn't be here'.  I think it's just that toxic part of me that self sabotages, and maybe it is, but it sits there, quietly, nagging at me.   <newline>  <newline> A year later and I'm crying every day. I'm so burnt out I don't know what normal feels. I'm finally on ritalin so I can think in a straight line and understand how messed up I am feeling.  The place I work is incredibly supportive, they go above and beyond to look after me in every possible way.  But I start to hide from my job, from my life. I'm sitting on the sofa (next to my wfh desk) most days, frozen, terrified, crying. Desperate to DO anything. I can even work from my phone with my job and I even start avoiding my phone.  Recently a side hustle I have requires extra time.  It doesn't even pay 1/3 of my day job in hourly rate but it's something else, and something else that makes me feel competent so my job falls further to the side, I'm in a full on mental health spiral but the side hustle is doing okay so win I guess?   <newline>  <newline> So I quit my day job.  My partner and I ran the budget, worked out the minimum I need to make so we can meet our bills, and we'll make life keep happening. <newline>  <newline> Today is my first day of 'I quit' life.  Old employer is so good they've hired me back as a contractor for limited hours in a smaller role, side hustle has a few hours.  My partner and I are going to sit down and draw up a list of stuff I've been wanting/needing to do around the house and life in general along with updating my CV and finding work so at least I have some structure each day.  <newline>  <newline> But.  <newline>  <newline> I'm scared. How do I find a new job that doesn't destroy me? How do I not spiral into a frozen panicked blob stuck on the sofa every day? How do I not destroy my (admittedly long and healthy) relationship by being some weirdo who abandoned her well paying job because despite pretty much everyone else who is also burnt out, and struggling, makes it to their job every day.  How do I keep going when I have nothing in me to keep going.  I'm meant to be working right now but instead I'm clutching a coffee, typing this up, trying not to cry, wondering how come, even with meds, I still can't be a normal adult who upholds the social contract.;pseudonymosaurus;False;142;0.99;2023-04-02 23:23:26;/r/adhdwomen/comments/12a20qj/remote_work_quitting_my_job_wtf_is_wrong_with_me/;adhdwomen
831;129sbr4;Overwhelming friend;UPDATE: Thank you all for your great advice. I've messaged her and she told me that she completely understands and that I can text her when I feel better. I've also scheduled a call with her for the beginning of May. Sometimes I forget I need to communicate my needs, thank you for the reminder 🩷 <newline>  <newline> Hi everyone, <newline>  <newline> TL:DR at the end <newline>  <newline> I'm looking for advice on how to handle one of my oldest friend who has become heavily over the top. By this I mean that she constantly sends me tons of messages (texts, memes, vocals...). Sometimes I open my phone and I have like 10-15 instagram videos + several 5 minutes vocals from her only. She complains about her problems, repeating herself, criticizing people, mainly negative stuffs. When we call, she dominates the conversation so much that I can sometimes not say anything for 15 minutes without interrupting her... I don't see her IRL really because I moved out of my home country. <newline>  <newline> I'm in my last year of PhD and my husband recently went through a life threatening situation, this all puts a lot of stress on me, and she knows about both these stuffs. <newline>  <newline> My strategy at the moment has been to stop going on social media, and ignoring my messaging app for a few days at a time. But as soon as I answer her, it feels like she is jumping to my throat by bombarding me with new messages about her problems, mainly, or futile details about anything in her life (she is the kind of person who can take 15 minutes to tell you about her trip to the supermarket because all the details need to be included). However, when I talk about my problems, she isn't really putting as much effort as me in conforting me (lately at least)... <newline>  <newline> TL:DR My friend is a chatterbox and is constantly venting to me about her problems, while not really putting as much effort as me into helping me with mine lately. I am in a great amount of stress (family health + work) and I feel harassed by her crazy amount of messages. My solution is ignoring her. <newline>  <newline> Have you ever been in a similar situation?

834;129j4ch;I used my terrible ADHD memory to stop my TikTok addiction;"I don't need to explain to anyone else here how **horribly addictive TikTok is** \- it's ADHD heroin. However, I don't want to delete the app fully, so I had to find a way to limit my time on it. <newline>  <newline> There's an option to put a **time limit** on your daily use, and when you hit that limit, you have to enter a 4 digit code to continue. <newline>  <newline> That is, of course, **totally useless**. It takes seconds to enter the code and keep scrolling - ""oh, I'll just look a few minutes more"". My self-control is not going to stand up to TikTok's raw dopamine stream. <newline>  <newline> To make this daily limit actually work, **I needed a code that I didn't know.** That's where I let my ADHD win.  <newline>  <newline> I couldn't just keysmash in a new code without looking, because you need to confirm it on the next screen. And I knew by the time I saw someone later in the day who wouldn't judge me for asking them to set a code on my account, I would forget to ask them.  <newline>  <newline> So I used my terrible ADHD memory to my advantage. **I needed to make up a code I wouldn't remember**, and the only way to do that was to *not think about it too much* ... which is very hard with ADHD.  <newline>  <newline> So I made sure I made up the code when my Vyvanse was still kicking in and before I was about to jump into an intense full-brain work call and a super busy work day - **something that would take up my whole focus long enough for me to forget**. <newline>  <newline> I only remembered that I had tried to lock down TikTok that evening after work.

837;128tg4r;Feeling so frustrated and tired with Rejection Sensitivity working up;I feel so tired and overwhelmed. And specifically with my RS making my emotions heightened so much. I also have BPD along with ADHD which is making it all the more tiring. The girl I was dating was so extremely rude to me today that I couldn't stop crying for straight 4 hours. And I know I didn't deserve it and she was projecting her issue at me but I can't stop feeling so sad. And this happened in the morning and I'm still feeling so low. <newline>  <newline> A little background. And TW, CW *abuse* <newline> Honestly I've never really dated properly. I'm pansexual yet I haven't found any person of any gender who'd treat me well or atleast be sensitive and mature. First few relationships in my college days and early 20s were with extremely abusive manipulative men. Which definitely hurt my self confidence a lot. <newline> So later I stopped dating cis men completely due to the amount of abuse I went through at their hands. Sexual, emotional, physical.. you name it. I forgave myself for falling for wrong men cause I was naive. Even though getting abused is not on me but not seeing/ignoring the obvious res flags are. <newline> But now that I started dating trans and cis women even then I get treated so badly. I always fall for people who either ghost me or make me feel so bad about myself. <newline> Today she was so so rude to me and I shared out entire chat on whatsapp with friends everyone agreed it was uncalled for. She even told me I'm difficult to have conversation with which I know is wrong because my RS from both BPD and ADHD makes me mimic people and be likeable. I go way beyond so that people like me and I know I'm not someone who is difficult to have conversation with. But she still said that just to hurt me and it has. Not the fact that she said hurtful things but that why I always start liking people who would do such things. <newline> I have no idea what about my personality is so bad that I can't attract good people. And I know I'm a good person. I always help people even the ones I don't know or not friends with. I keep my patience even when it's so hard with ADHD and BPD. I believe it doesn't take people much to be a good person. I just don't understand what I have done to always get yelled at or be abused. <newline> What it is about me that makes people who I fall for think they can be so rude to me?! I don't understand at all. <newline> I'm so tired of trying to navigate this world all alone dealing with all the people in it and all the time getting hurt. <newline> At this point I've started to believe I'm the problem and I'm so so tired.;medusas_girlfriend90;False;1;1.0;2023-04-01 17:50:18;/r/adhdwomen/comments/128tg4r/feeling_so_frustrated_and_tired_with_rejection/;adhdwomen

840;127q0t2;Ableism and lack of accountability on Insta;"The other day, a ""therapist"" I follow on Instagram made an extremely harmful post where he blamed mass shootings on executive dysfunction and tied it in with ADHD and Autism. There was very little in the way of nuanced information and no statistics. Multiple people commented on the post telling him how harmful his words were and also disproving his claims. Within a couple of hours he turned off the option to comment and soon after removed all comments entirely.  <newline>  <newline> Even though he knows full well why the post is harmful he has left it up and just made an unapologetic ""you don't understand"" edit to the caption. So now his harmful post is still there to be misused or misconstrued by others and without any chance for people to see why it's wrong. <newline>  <newline> Now, today, he has made a post about accountability and recognising when you've got something wrong ... yet STILL hasn't corrected his actions from the other day. People have asked in comments on other posts if he will remove it and he just talks about how people shouldn't ""shame"" him and he's ""processing"" with his community. <newline>  <newline> Yes I could just unfollow, but I'm so angry that a ""therapist"" with 54.1k followers is still not correcting his actions. ND folks have to deal with enough issues already, never mind being lumped in with mass murderers. <newline>  <newline> I've left polite but firm comments asking him to remove the post and will continue to do so until he blocks me or removes it. I would ask others to join me, but I'm not sure if that is allowed here. Still just needed to vent though 😤 <newline>  <newline> (As a side note, he's a cisgender white man, so hardly surprising he doesn't like admitting he's wrong) <newline>  <newline> UPDATE: The post has been taken down 🥳🥳🥳 I kept reporting it and also messaged a few people on Insta who he followed or ND folks with big followings.

841;1274u3s;Dealing with Cruelty as an Adult;"I have lost so many friends, family members and relationships to ADHD.  <newline>  <newline> My last close friend, who had also hired me when I really needed work, blew up at me one day when I told her I was really angry about something. I simply had no impulse control after her dog, who I was dog sitting as a favor, attacked a friend's puppy. I texted her to say, ""I'm really angry you never told me Annie was aggressive toward other dogs, I didn't sleep last night and am super triggered."" My ADHD got the better of me in the stress, and I fired off a couple more texts, telling her I'm sorry if I'm not making sense, I realize I'm being irrational and just super reactive right now, but I want you to come get Annie right now, etc."" (please let me know if you need details) <newline>  <newline> She texted me, ""You're a loose canon. I've always known that. You're a liability to me, my company and my family. Never contact me again.""  <newline>  <newline> I am still in shock. In two years of very close friendship, I had never expressed any anger toward her, but I know I can be very reactive and she's seen that side of me (calling an insurance company). I told her it was something I was working on in confidence. We have been through an incredible amount of stress independently this year, and I have done everything to thank her for her friendship and make the most out of any opportunity she offered me.  <newline>  <newline> I'm remembering how other close relationships ended. One friend blurted out, ""You're toxic, and you need to handle your ADHD,"" in a heated moment where money was involved.  <newline>  <newline> Another 'best' friend of several years suddenly avoided me for weeks. When we finally met up, she screamed in my face, ""You're always a victim!"" I was so taken aback and still don't know how to process that feedback. She essentially told me she didn't want me in her life because of how I made her feel or something, but was super vague and I never figured out what exactly the problem was. I just got canceled. <newline>  <newline> Yet another 'best' friend of years, who had been amazing, randomly accused me of stealing from her (I have never stolen in my life, not even close), which still shocks me. She literally called the police on me and accused me of 'identity theft.' I was absolutely terrified, and an attorney told me not to speak to her again. I can't believe it. Like... wth? I still don't really have any closure. I know she was having a hard time, but if you know me at all you know I would literally never even think of that, plus she accused me of stealing 'sleeping bags,' and 'headphones,' which were just so random. I freaked out.  <newline>  <newline> My ex of a year and a half and I had a magical Friday together. We lived together and stayed up all night laughing and playing games. He told me, ""You're such a great partner."" He went on a camping trip, overnight, I picked him up, and he looked at me and said, ""I fucking hate you."" And jumped out of the car. I never saw him again, and dividing our stuff was a complete nightmare. He 100% refused to speak to me. I still have some very valuable things of his nearly two years later. We had a dog together, and he dropped the dogs leash when I jumped out and gave it to him, and was like, ""this isn't my dog."" Like, bro.

But they were so abrupt, cruel and hateful toward me. Like, wow. I can't imagine speaking to someone that way, much less a good friend. And 100% of the time, it's linked to some kind of ADHD tendency I have. Anyway, any suggestions for processing this? Finding people who are kind and understanding of the ADHD personality/ brain?

850;125vdi2;So DAE feel like you have no idea how you are perceived by others in terms of appearance, intelligence, skills whatever?;"So I saw this thing on TikTok (not saying it's reliable) but something I could relate to - I literally have no way to establish a scale to measure my worth in anything. I am not looking for self-esteem validation - I am already in therapy for working on my identity etc.  <newline>  <newline> But what I feel sometimes is that I cannot really understand how other people see me? Like if someone has a good time with me - I'd be like they are being polite. If someone compliments how I look - I'd be like it's just a thing people say.. You know? Same with my work and research. My advisor says it's going great and I am like he just doesn't want me to feel crappy.  But I guess at a base level, I have no clue about my societal worth and consequently I cannot believe it when people say nice thing. Does everyone feel that or is it an ADHD thing? I mean it could simply be a self esteem thing but I can't help but feel self esteem is one thing and not able to ""read"" and confirm how people perceive you is another. Does it even matter? Dunno? How is normal supposed to look like? <newline>  <newline> Edit: It's so damn validating to see that I am not alone in this and I dunno if I could reply to each and every comment.

851;125v7uk;ADHD, Depression, or just lazy?;"Hello everyone! I'm hoping if you have time you can read this and give me some advice or thoughts, or let me know if you experience something similar. <newline>  <newline> I'm 25 and am trying to book an appt for a psych eval so I can try to figure out what's wrong with my brain lol. My dad and sister have both been diagnosed with ADHD, so that's what makes me so curious to find out if I have it too. I've struggled my whole life with procrastination, I'd wait until the very last minute to do my homework in HS/College (a lot of times on purpose) because I needed that anxiety and stress to motivate me. And since I was always able to succeed that way, I used it as a coping mechanism my whole academic life and got mostly As until I graduated. <newline>  <newline> Adulthood has been very different. Living alone and having a boring job with tons of freedom, I can't find any motivation to do even the smallest amount of work. Technically I'm able to work from home but I've been told by others that I should be in the office more regularly to do my job the best. But it's so hard for me to get myself to go in to work, and at home it feels impossible to get any work done. The fear of being fired would usually be enough for me, but due to the circumstances of my position they will not fire me. In fact I've never gotten any bad feedback about my lack of productivity. Without the threat of punishment or accountability, I procrastinate even the smallest task, that is until someone asks for an update. Then I will jump into action and get the task done as soon as possible (the people pleasing kicks in as a motivator).  <newline>  <newline> Basically every day for the past 3 years has been like this: wake up to my alarm, give in to impulse to snooze - I think ""I don't care, I'll deal with the consequences later."" I sleep until noon, then get up to sit on my couch and scroll through my phone, doom scrolling tiktok or obsessively googling mental health symptoms to try to figure out why the hell I can't get myself to do anything. I go back and forth for hours ""just get up, just start the task, it'll be easier once you start, you're a terrible person "", ""but I don't want to. I just want to sit here and avoid everything. I want to hide. I'll deal with it later. It's not that serious."" Once the ""work day"" is done (around 4pm) I feel like ""well, it didn't happen today, it'll happen tomorrow"" and play video games until midnight until I'm exhausted. No chores done, no self care done, and no work done. Repeat the next day.  <newline>  <newline> I have so much guilt and shame around this but can't help give in to the voice in my head telling me to just ""do what I want,"" which ends up being avoidant impulsive behavior. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been taking zoloft for the past month, and the behaviors have not gotten any better. In fact I feel less anxiety and more numb about things, which has been a problem since I've used anxiety as a motivator for so long.  <newline>  <newline> So, do you think this sounds like potential ADHD, at least worth getting an assessment done? <newline>  <newline> If you took the time to read this, thank you.

863;122u2xx;RE: Has anyone taken Adderalll while pregnant?;"Hello All! I made a post a couple months back about taking adderall during pregnancy and the groups experiences with it. Since then I have talked to 3 different medical professionals (OB, PCP, and Psych) and used my neurotic need for information to do research. Not ""uncle Joe on Facebook research"" I mean institutes and medical journals. Verified information. What I found was equally frustrating as it was helpful. (reminder: I am \*not\* a medical profession nor is this medical advice, just information I found interesting)  <newline>  <newline> Majority of research surrounding adderall use during pregnancy (and lactation) was looking at recreational and abuse dosages. None of the studies were able to guarantee that the participants weren't also doing other drugs, drinking, or other high risk behaviors that are well researched to cause issues with a developing fetus. This was frustrating as I probably live the most boring low-risk lifestyle and general recommendations go off of the high risk studies.  <newline>  <newline> All the studies surrounding therapeutic dosages are much smaller and vary in age but pretty much all of them show little if any increased risk to a growing fetus or breastfeed infant. Obviously there are not a lot of people who are eager to potentially put their baby at risk for science if they don't need to.  <newline>  <newline> My psych recommended the website [MotherToBaby](https://mothertobaby.org) for more information as they're a great resource for medication interactions between mother and baby during pregnancy and lactation. It felt really validating (and frustrating) to see that all the studies I found were referenced here. I was low-key hoping they would have additional information I hadn't found but it was reassuring at least someone in the medical industry was aware of the non-recreational and abuse data. [MotherToBaby Adderall Info](https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/methamphetaminedextroamphetamine-pregnancy/) <newline>  <newline> My potential need for my medication is no longer a main concern of mine. I found a psych and OB that are very comfortable helping me manage it during pregnancy if needed and the research and data is reassuring that it's not as big of a deal for me personally as I already take a smaller dose, only take it when I work, and live an otherwise low risk lifestyle.  <newline>  <newline> Do what makes you comfortable and do your research folks :)";izziedays;False;1;1.0;2023-03-26 17:56:20;/r/adhdwomen/comments/122u2xx/re_has_anyone_taken_adderalll_while_pregnant/;adhdwomen
864;122ov4s;What does being a good listener look like with ADHD?;General premise/ question(s): <newline> Behaviors caused by/ associated with our ADHD can make it hard for us to either be good listeners or be perceived as good listeners. <newline>  <newline> Do you feel like you are a good listener? <newline>  <newline> Have you found it harder to master because of your ADHD? <newline>  <newline> If you are a good listener, what helps you actually listen well?  <newline>  <newline> Do you find that your behavior of good listening appears in opposition to what others say good listening looks like? <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> A bit of background: <newline> I recently watched this [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/ted_ed_4_things_all_great_listeners_know?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) about what good listening is (video is only 5 min). I appreciated that they admit how some of good listening is simply performative and that they said this won’t come without practice. <newline>  <newline> Personal context: <newline>  <newline> The video made me think about what I look like when I’m deeply listening.  <newline>  <newline> I’m often not looking at the speaker, instead I  might stare off into space. If I’m deeply listening it feels akin to being lost in a book, my eyes unfocus so I can refocus internally to make a picture of what they are saying.  <newline>  <newline> Mindlessly fidgeting or knitting also helps deepen my focus on the speaker. Most importantly, it keeps me from doing the number one good listening no-no, interrupting. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> In summary: <newline>  <newline> The things that help me actually listen make it seem like I am not listening. I want to find a balance because I do think good listening is import to being supportive in all relationships: being a better partner, friend, co-worker etc.  <newline>  <newline> Sometimes I find myself saying, “I can look like I’m listening or I can listen, but I can’t do both.” I wonder if it’s fair to ask people to adjust their expectations on what the performance of good listening looks like. <newline>  <newline> Have you found that balance?  <newline>  <newline> Do you struggle like me? <newline>  <newline> Bonus extra:  <newline>  <newline> I got to the video above through a youtube rabbit hole which started with [this cool one](https://youtu.be/e9-l34TcV_U) about the middle ages.;HeyItsJuls;False;7;0.67;2023-03-26 14:58:28;/r/adhdwomen/comments/122ov4s/what_does_being_a_good_listener_look_like_with/;adhdwomen

867;121xeav;The video that changed my perspective on ADHD;I’m sure this has been posted on here before, but still.. I wanna share it anyways. <newline>  <newline> I always used to view my ADHD as something that was ‘wrong with me’. As a flaw. I’ve seen myself as a failure for so long and I felt like I could never live up to my potential because of my ADHD. When I saw this video I instantly started crying (I pushed my emotions away for a loooong time so that was something special for me) because I realized that I wasn’t a failure. I was just.. different. And when you know how to cope with being different, so many good things can arise from it. <newline>  <newline> I finally found the right dose of meds (Vyvanse: 30mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon) and I finally started therapy (also for the BPD I developed partly because of my untreated ADHD) and I’ve been soaking up loads of information about it which made me understand myself so much more. I found some content creators with ADHD I can relate to so much, and I’m just like.. damn. I felt so alone for so long. But I’m not. And it’s such a relieve to realize that.  <newline>  <newline> Well.. I didn’t really get to the point I was trying to make. Still got ADHD 😂 but the video I’m talking about is a TED-talk by Jessica McCabe (How to ADHD). Please watch it if you haven’t done it yet.

While watching movies I've never watched before, I will finish the actors' line before they've said it, and 90% of the time I get it exactly right. I can't help it, most of the time I say it in my head, but when I'm at home I'll say it out loud during the movie. <newline>  <newline> My husband once asked if I'd seen the movie before (because I had finished so many of the lines in the movie) and I said, ""no, but doesn't everyone do this in their head? Finish the sentence in the movie because it's so predictable what they're about to say?"" and he said, ""No, I don't. I just watch the movie."" I also asked my kids and they don't do it either. <newline>  <newline> So I just assumed it was just me, with my pointless talent. Until I saw this today.. https://www.facebook.com/reel/579257094258813?mibextid=9drbnH&s=yWDuG2&fs=e. - I am guilty of finishing people's sentences for them sometimes..

I am addicted to the immediate feeling of escape upon opening the app and beginning my scroll. I'm subscribed to lots of productive subs, like this one (I consider it helpful),  but I'm also subbed to trash like snarking subs, because man I love those things. But it's just filling my head with garbage, as my life falls apart around me. I can't even describe the relief I feel when I tell myself I'll just take a ""quick"" bath and ""read"" for awhile. It's never quick and I don't think you can really call it reading. I mean, it is reading technically, but whatever, it's just a lie I tell myself to get that quick dopamine drop and feel like everything's ok, I'll get back to the important stuff right after this.    <newline>  <newline>  <newline> But there have been days where I have scrolled all day long. If the time is 11:37, I'll tell myself it's fine, 12 on the dot is the perfect time to close it and get to work. I think you all know what happens next. Oh, I didn't make 12, But 12:30, that's good, and the insanity goes on and on until I feel disgusted with myself. Oh and the anxiety grows all the time, but giving myself those little time limits (that I never end up following through on) falsely relieves that anxiety for a little, and even gives me a little more dopamine I guess.   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> At one point, I made a username strictly for all the productive subs, no trash.

I love this stupid website.I feel like if I could delete all my social media, including Reddit, I might be able to do it. But the nature of my business pretty much makes that impossible. I have to keep FB, I have to keep Instagram. Again, with those, I attempted to unfollow all my friends and keep my feed business only. But again, even with that, I'll find myself reading the comments on situations or topics that are not doing anything but giving my brain info it does not need in the moment. It might be helpful or educational, but it's still just enjoyable reading that I have no business doing in the middle of a work day.   <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I guess this was just a sort of rant.

879;11y3u3q;Feeling terrible about school and life;I’m 31. I’ve been working on a finance degree for 6 years now. Diagnosed at 28-changed my life. <newline>  <newline> I never did well in highschool because of undiagnosed ADHD and tumultuous home life, personal life, trauma etc. <newline>  <newline> Never though I’d go to university. Fast forward to me at 25, I decide I should go to university. I get accepted to my city’s second best school after doing a ton of highschool upgrading. This apprently wasn’t good enough for me so I decide I want to transfer to the city’s best school. (Dumb in retrospect, they’re pretty similar in terms of quality).  <newline>  <newline> So I spend 2 years taking classes at 4 different schools at the same time (My goal school wouldn’t transfer all my courses) in order to get into the school. I took calculus 4 times before I passed. School became a hyperfocus and I did well. I burnt myself out. <newline>  <newline> I got into my goal school. Covid happens and school is online now. So I get 2 of the 4 years at my goal school to spend on campus. I’m bummed about that. <newline>  <newline> Then I decide I want to renovate my house. I wear myself thin doing everything. School, work, renovating. <newline>  <newline> Now I’m about to graduate. I don’t want to work in finance, I hate school, I’m 31, I’m burnt out. My huperfocus for school faded and I started half-assing it. I never did any extracurriculars: no internships, no clubs, etc. <newline>  <newline> I was a stripper for 10 years and a very susccesful one so I saved a lot of money. it was hard to prioritize school when I could make 1k per night. I was sleep deprived at school a lot. Paid off my house in full and started a business: successful bachelor party company so I could book myself even more. No student debt. Can’t talk about my business at school.  <newline>  <newline> At one point I’m flying to another city every weekend to work. I have a condo in another city while going to university in my homtiwn on weekdays. <newline>  <newline> Anyways. Looking around at all these 23 year old kids graduating with me… how the fuck did you manage to be a teachers assitant, research assistant, deans list, all these extracurriculars I’ve never ever heard of… they’re all <newline> so bright and hungry. They are all going to job interviews. I’m jealous of them and how supported they must have been to get there. When I was 23 I was insane, playing in bands, on drugs, stripping. Wild. I had fun but I wanted more. ADHD explains a lot about those years. Like how are these 23 year olds so put together? At 23 I was always unorganized and my clothes were dirty. <newline>  <newline> I’m tired and burnt out. My resume is 10 years of nothing I can talk about even though I am successful.  <newline>  <newline> I think I went to business school to prove to myself I’m smart? Internalized whorephobia and feeling like a lazy failure from undiagnosed ADHD. <newline>  <newline> I don’t know what the future holds for me. I honestly just want to keep stripping- I keep making more and more doing that with my business growing and it’s such a ADHD compatible job. I don’t want any other job but of course, one day I will need to. <newline>  <newline> Last thing I want to do is kiss corporate ass and have a cheesy Linkedin where I kiss more ass like “I’m thrilled to announce I’m an intern account manager at Deloitte- So excited” PUKE could not be me. But I just spent 6 years setting myself up for that… I was hoping I would have it figured out by now.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Can you relate?;RobinTrix;False;4;1.0;2023-03-22 02:27:54;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11y3u3q/feeling_terrible_about_school_and_life/;adhdwomen

881;11xoerg;Try to fixate on exercise...;I have been exercising for a couple weeks now. I can't believe how much better I feel.  <newline>  <newline> I want to shout from the rooftops, try and fixate on exercise and see what a difference it might make for you!  <newline>  <newline> What finally got me going was I got fixated on Hydrojug and similar water bottles that can hold your phone and keys.  <newline>  <newline> I also luckily moved to a new building with good amenities.  <newline>  <newline> Then I discover a few apps that work together to guide me through workouts and gamify a couple goals. I have an app for the elliptical machine, one for aerobic exercises, and one for aerobics just for the butt. They all sync to Google Fit, which can also track your steps if you let it access your location. <newline>  <newline> When I started out, it was really awkward, so I turned to YouTube to learn how to use an elliptical machine and how to do certain aerobic moves properly. That really helped to bring me into the rabbit hole a bit. There is a lot to learn and a ton of information all over!  <newline>  <newline> I could go on and on but my point is I feel a difference mentally, emotionally, and physically. And it's fun!

882;11x295n;Help;"I need help <newline>  <newline> Hello community! I am recovering from cancer. My girlfriend is dissociating from the horrible stuff we went through in the last months, she trades all day (,not her work) and high risk, I think she is in debts and lost all her money again.  <newline> Due to medical negligence I was manic and psychotic during chemo and I was a bitch to her to say the least.  <newline> She is Chinese and doesn't ""believe in therapy"" she doesn't feel ok with it because she feels it implies she has ""the mental problem"" which I already have a collection of so I guess she is afraid of being batshit like me. <newline>  <newline> I'm broke, and weak, all I could think about was that I need to make her stop somehow to gain time and try to get some help somehow. I know only when she accepts she has a problem and when she wants she can receive help.  <newline> My bright idea was: <newline> I made a bet, if I can make a YouTube (we talk about the chanel for months already, not really my thing to film myself) channel and gain 100 followers in one week she will stop the trading for a week and will spend this time in her actual work or studying English. If I lose, I will shut the duck up about trading for 28 days, and if I dare mentioning it I will give her 10 euro for each time I mention it (like if I have that kind of money lol). <newline>  <newline> I haven't started and I am feeling like this was a very bad idea, to encourage the betting behaviour.

885;11vqsv3;UPDATE: Refused a diagnostic test by psychologist;"This is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/118f05r/refused_a_diagnostic_test_by_psychologist/ <newline>  <newline> Tldr: after being refused a diagnostic test by a psychologist, I seeked a 2nd opinion with a well-rated professional. Did Diva5 with her. She had no doubts that my symptoms were specific to ADHD. I am on the path to getting an official diagnosis. Trust your gut.  <newline>  <newline> Long version: <newline> I'm not sure what the etiquette is regarding updates on reddit and how to make sure the kind people who commented on the post see it. But I wanted to share this in case someone with a similar experience is browsing the subreddit and wonders what happened next or what they should do in this position. <newline>  <newline> I listened to the advice I got from the comments (and from my regular psychoterapist), and I'm happy I did. I decided to look for a second opinion because what I heard during the meeting I described in my original post just didn't sit right with me.  <newline>  <newline> This time, I did hours of research instead of taking the first result that popped up on google after entering ""adhd adult diagnosis + my city."" I researched places that specialize in adult ADHD in my country and checked the opinions on the psychologists and psychiatrists working there, both on pages dedicated to posting opinions about doctors and on facebook groups dedicated to adults with ADHD. Eventually, I found a diagnostician psychologist who was described by patients as both well-educated on the topic (she has even published papers on adult ADHD) and empathetic, listening to what people said. She sounded like what I was looking for, and I made an appointment (online).  <newline>  <newline> She did Diva5 with me. A lot of the responses I gave were things I spoke about with (or rather to, as it was hardly a dialogue) the first diagnostician.  <newline>  <newline> The meeting was 2 hours long. She actually asked relevant questions (as opposed to asking me 3 times if I had a happy childhood despite me saying yes every time). When I described a symptom, she asked follow-up questions and made notes. She even asked me about my sleeping issues and misophonia.  <newline>  <newline> Afterwards, she said that she needs to count up the points, but it's just a formality - the symptoms and situations I described were very specific to ADHD in women.  <newline>  <newline> My next step is visiting a psychiatrist with the results of Diva5, as this is the procedure in my country - only a psychiatrist can give you an official diagnosis. I will be going to the same clinic for that.  <newline>  <newline> So, for anyone browsing this subreddit at 4 a.m., doubting themselves or wondering if the medical professional who dismissed their worries was right - don't give up. Sure, your self diagnosis might end up not confirmed. Maybe it's something else. But after your meeting with a medical professional, you should feel heard and seen. If you felt in any way dismissed, not listened to, confused, and in deep disagreement with what was said during your meeting, don't doubt your gut.

887;11vijs0;Learned Helplessness;I've mentioned this before, but I wanted to talk about it again and share a bit of success with you all.  <newline>  <newline> I think we've all heard of learned helplessness before. I had, but when I read about it a few months ago it really struck home for me, so let me recap what it is: <newline>  <newline> In psychological experiments into behaviour and learning, animals, such as rats, were placed in a box or maze with food or a way of getting food. At some point the environment was set up so that the animal was not able to get to the food. Nothing they did would get them the reward. Eventually, the animals stopped trying - to the point that when the food was actually available and reachable again, the animals didn't even try to get it. They'd learnt that it was pointless.  <newline>  <newline> That, honestly, sounded like me. I'd tried and tried for years, and failed over and over, until eventually so many things felt utterly pointless to even try. *I've tried over and over to keep my kitchen clean, but it never works so why try?* or *last time I tidied my room I worked for hours and hours and still didn't finish (plus all the other times this has happened in the past), and by the next day it was a mess again - I just don't have the energy to waste on something so pointless.* It could also be summed up as *it's never worked: it won't work now* or *I just can't do it*.  <newline>  <newline> But what really struck me was how the animals reacted once they were shown that the food was available to them again: they went right back to doing whatever it was they needed to do to get the food, forgetting - or at least ignoring - all their failures. <newline>  <newline> And me? I was finally medicated properly last summer, but my behaviour hadn't changed. I was still living with my own learned helplessness, and there was no observing scientist to point out that success was within reach. My therapist was helping but we weren't making much progress which was just adding to my impression that it was impossible, for all that I wanted change. Where a rat could overcome its maladaptive behaviours in minutes or hours, I couldn't in weeks or months. It made me feel so much worse. But then I thought about it a bit more. Those rats were unable to get the food for a few minutes, days, or in a few cases weeks. I'd been unable to do things reliably for *decades*. Of course the rats unlearned that behaviour so much faster than I did! It's not that I'm less capable than a rat, it's just that no rat has ever had to unlearn 30+ years of failure for me to be able to read about it.  <newline>  <newline> So. It was just down to me in the end. Learned helplessness was my biggest problem, now that my ADHD was medicated, and I live alone and WFH, so I was going to have to show myself that what I wanted/needed to do was possible ***despite myself***.  <newline>  <newline> Maybe none of you feel any kind of resonance with this, maybe it's completely alien, but on the off chance it sounds a bit like you, here are things I've found that work: <newline>  <newline>  <newline> - lists  <newline> Yes, lists. How I hated them! They were the worst. But instead of a to-do list, I kept a Done list. At first I had to note down things like breakfast, coffee, lunch, dinner, work, because that's all I had, and not even that many every day. But gradually I was adding things like washing up, shower, gym... Now it's more like gym, shower, prep x y z classes, study, washing up, washing, clothes away, make bed, message so and so, etc. And I stop and update my list whenever I feel like I'm running out of steam. Thanks to my meds I actually don't feel terrible doing things like the washing up, and I'm not so forgetful so I remember to study, and my list lets me feel a bit of achievement  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> - wireless headphones  <newline> These have been a gamechanger. I no longer have to plan my outfit to have pockets to be able to wash up or cook or do anything else that was inconvenient with wired headphones, and simply being able to throw on any clothes has made mornings so much easier. Also, now I can have Youtube, a Podcast or an audio book on as I'm washing up or cleaning and actually understand what's being said despite kitchen noise. That makes tedious tasks much easier.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> - exercise <newline> I'm sorry. I know most of us don't want to hear it - I didn't! - but exercise really helps. It's great for your whole body and, for all it can feel gruelling, it really does produce happy hormones that make every boring task so much easier. It's really it's own reward <newline>  <newline>  <newline> - another list  <newline> Once my done list began growing, I started making a to-do, but always adding on things I'd already done. Breakfast ✅, get dressed ✅, clean kitchen 15 mins, make appointment... But I also only added things that were completely realistic. It didn't matter if something important didn't make it onto the list if it's something I didn't think I'd get done anyway - this is about teaching myself that I ***can*** do things, not getting things done!  <newline>  <newline> That's where I'm at now. Yesterday I cleaned most of my flat and deep-cleaned my kitchen. That's incredible for me, and best of all I didn't feel like crying or simply wishing to die at any point. It felt doable, rather than like I was trying to climb everest in boxing gloves and flip-flops. Not every day is particularly productive, but I don't feel physically repulsed by the thought of sweeping my floor, or changing my bedding. I don't need to worry that if I change my bedding I might be sleeping on a bare mattress tonight.  <newline>  <newline> I don't know if this is helpful to anyone, but if it is it was worth writing.;Bohred_Atom;False;8;0.98;2023-03-19 11:10:32;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11vijs0/learned_helplessness/;adhdwomen

890;11ut3m8;ADHD/Anxiety/depression and conflicting reports from my primary PA and a therapist;RANT ALERT. Just getting my thoughts out there. <newline>  <newline> List of struggles at work: never slowing down/always feeling like I need to do something, not being careful, forgetfulness, chatterbox, interrupts others, impulsive helpfulness aka doing everything for everyone, disorganized, poor time management, overly emotional when criticized, non-confrontational and insecure, always thinking negative thoughts about myself. <newline> I don't understand inferences. <newline>  <newline> List of struggles at home: lazy, sleeping too much, disorganized, procrastination, impulsive spending, lack of motivation to do chores, spend hours on YouTube or Reddit rather than clean/cook/healthy habits, one hobby gets all the attention for a while and then is not touched until it's used as a distraction from a chore, cycles of starting a healthy habit and then failing to continue and feeling like it's never going to work so why bother, looking at a cluttered space for weeks until I panic clean, minimizing my issues, trouble organizing my thoughts to express how I feel (even in this post).  <newline>  <newline> My primary PA I see at the base medical center diagnosed me with ADHD and anxiety 3 weeks ago. I started with 10mg IR adderall taken only on work days and found it to be life changing at work. I was calm/relaxed, focused on one thing at a time, let others talk without interruption, did not jump to do things too fast, was able to think through problems, and actually took my 30 min lunch break without getting up every few minutes to check on things. I experienced side effects but could easily recognize them and they didn't bother me too much. I got used to the medication and now am starting to struggle again at work. She suggested I consider taking lexapro as well to help with anxiety/depression. I'm anxious about that medication because of the side effects. But I know I need to try something. <newline>  <newline> I decided to see a therapist so I could help myself more. The first and only therapy session I had was a complete disaster from my perspective. I don't think I organized how I was feeling very well because I turned into a blubbering mess talking about things that were happening at work and home. I cry whenever I feel criticized and talking about my failures is the hardest thing ever. So even though I know I have been struggling my whole life, I only said what had been happening over the last few weeks. She said I would have had to have these issues my whole life to be diagnosed with ADHD. I agree, but I was overwhelmed in the meeting and didn't know how to tell her how I have been struggling and coping my whole life. The last few weeks have been like a volcano of issues exploding. She asked what my chief complaint was... I didn't say anything for a while because I didn't know how to answer. I eventually panicked and just said I wanted to be less anxious. Even though that wasn't what I wanted to say. She said I was just like a broken car that needed to be fixed and my problem was anxiety. Therefore I needed to take intermittent breaks and find ways to calm down. I don't agree, but just nodded my head and agreed with her. She seems reluctant to jump into an ADHD diagnosis, despite the PA diagnosis.

893;11t90vv;(Vent) Realizing that I’ve had ADHD my whole life has been an adjustment;If you’re sick of “I was diagnosed as an adult, here is how it fucked me up” posts, keep scrolling lol. Warning for internalized ableism?  <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to share my experience as a someone who was “recently” diagnosed 5 months ago and how it’s been different from what I was expecting. <newline>  <newline> First of all: I don’t think I realized how much the “girl who only talks about her self diagnosed ADHD after looking at some posts on tiktok” stereotype affected me until now.  <newline>  <newline> When I first got diagnosed, I knew rationally that I had done a lot of symptom tracking and followed legitimate avenues to get a diagnosis, but it’s safe to say that I was still dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome. I honestly believed deep down that the curtain would be pulled back and I would realize I was identifying with a community I never belonged in. The accommodations my school provided me dramatically improved my quality of life. My medication practically cured my binge eating overnight. It gave me relief from excessive fatigue. This /terrified/ me, because I was scared that I invented a ‘narrative’ for my own gain. My therapist told me he thought it was obvious to him that I had it from the start. The RN assessing me for a diagnosis had experience with women being diagnosed as adults, and I just talked and she didn’t question my experiences, 20 minutes later I had diagnosed ADHD. It went so smoothly that it made me feel suspicious that I manipulated everyone like puppets on strings. <newline>  <newline> Before therapy, no one ever tried to help me get support. No one ever even insinuated that I was ‘different’ (I know, yikes, I’m sorry). There were no well intentioned recommendations or suggestions on what I could be dealing with from people who were familiar with my behaviour. No report cards or parent teacher conferences with comments raising red flags. Never any external acknowledgement that I struggle with anything at all. It’s just been me, some subreddits, google, and shaky memories of nights spent crying staring at my homework wishing I had an answer for why my body and brain refused to cooperate.  <newline>  <newline> Now it’s been 5 months. The symptoms have NOT gone away. Obviously the medication has had great impacts on my attention and therefore cognitive functioning: I can mentally process new math concepts,I can drive to an address and remember how I got there, and I can slow down and consider my thoughts before speaking.   <newline> But now that I am aware of it, my moments of dysfunction are no longer just my unique quirks, they’re just glaring signs of ADHD that i never had the ability to identify. I thought that by this point I would start realizing I was wrong, imagined all my symptoms, or have an extremely mild case of it that isn’t comparable to “real ADHD” that all the stereotypes are based off of. I couldn’t have been more wrong.  I never had a reason to think about it before, but the truth is that I have always identified as being someone who is neurotypical, and perceived everything about myself through that lens.  <newline>  <newline> Now it’s like I don’t recognize myself in my behaviours, because my sense of ‘self’ was in large part a product of denial. It’s one thing to come to terms with how you have changed and are currently changing as a person, but it’s another thing to realize that I’ve been ‘the ADHD kid’ my entire life but was completely in the dark about it. None of my friends said anything before, but when I tell them I got diagnosed, they all accept it like they knew from the start, were surprised I didn’t know, or at the very least felt that it explained a lot about what they knew about me.  <newline>  <newline> Anyways. Im sure this identity crisis will pass soon enough, it just felt good to write it all out instead of sitting here feeling off/not myself. There is probably some hidden internalized ableism that I’m inevitably going to have to face in the coming months that is contributing to this. I apologize in advance if any of that is coming through but I also wanted to be honest with myself about how I feel at this point .

901;11r7r3j;Is this ADHD?;Hello! Sorry for the long post ahead. I (22F) am yet to visit a psychologist because I've been very busy with university. Anyway, I noticed how hard it is for me to focus ever since the pandemic, which required me to be alone most of the time. I don't know if I'm just lazy or not, but this is what my typical day looks like: <newline>  <newline> - it's super hard for me to get up and start my day. I often open my phone first, then start scrolling on Reddit or Youtube (sometimes for hours) <newline>  <newline> - ever since I was young, I would stand in the shower and not take a bath immediately. Just standing. Or sometimes I would wet my feet until I feel like taking a bath. Sometimes it takes me 45 mins to finish taking a bath <newline>  <newline> - I can't read long posts or watch long videos. If I'm interested in a video I'm watching, I set the speed to 1.5x to 2x so I can finish it faster <newline>  <newline> - there are things I want to do like read a book or watch a movie, but I just don't. Instead, I just sit or lie down, and then I'd regret later on for wasting time <newline>  <newline> - my closet is a mess. I have unfolded clothes since last year. I try to organize them, but I cant seem to finish doing so because I would get tired and bored <newline>  <newline> - in connection to my previous bullet, it takes me so long to finish cleaning because I end up looking at old photos or play around with stuff I find <newline>  <newline> - a bit of a throwback, but as a kid, I couldn't finish eating within an hour. I would just play with my food or walk around. I once climbed on a cabinet with breakables, and ofc the cabinet toppled. I broke everything in that cabinet. <newline>  <newline> - I always put things under the rug and then end up forgetting my deadlines. Aside from deadlines, I am super forgetful. I forget to perform my mom's simple instructions like preheating the oven, etc. <newline>  <newline> - so many things saved for later (reddit, Youtube, screencaps, etc), and I haven't checked any one of them <newline>  <newline> - I suffer from severe anxiety. I cannot work when anxious, so I end up just crying or panicking until I'm not <newline>  <newline> - even when I am sleepy, I don't sleep immediately because I always look for things to do like check my phone, check my emails MULTIPLE times, refresh Reddit, etc. and then I would once again regret for spending 3 hours on my phone <newline>  <newline> These are just some of the things I struggle with. I am also seeing a psychologist for depression screening because I've been feeling empty and lost for almost 2 years now <newline>  <newline> If you have read until this point, thank you so much.;AccurateAttorney_629;False;2;0.6;2023-03-14 14:34:17;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11r7r3j/is_this_adhd/;adhdwomen
902;11qsp82;ADHD in crisis mode;Any thoughts/advice for coping with crisis and ADHD? My husband has been in the hospital for a little over six weeks now, and I am struggling. <newline>  <newline> In the beginning, I was actually handling things pretty well, I think. Unfortunately, every day was something new to deal with, and I was off work while he was at his sickest, so I only had to focus on the crisis at hand and then tackle the next thing. <newline>  <newline> But after three weeks, my husband was doing better and I was running out of PTO, so I went back to work. And ever since, it's been this game of executive function rationing, and I feel like I'm losing. My sleep schedule has been totally out of whack since all this started, so I typically wake up too late, attempt to get some work done (I work from home and have a ridiculously supportive workplace and boss), but I typically have to nap at somepoint because of lack of sleep, then I go to the hospital for a few hours in the evening. When I get home from the hospital, I end up spending hours trapped on the couch scrolling, with YouTube in the background. I go to bed too late, and then the whole cycle begins again. But by the time I get home from the hospital, it's like I'm out of executive function, and I can't actually make myself do anything ... like GO TO BED.  <newline>  <newline> I realize that situations like these, you're just in survival mode, but I feel like I'm teetering on an edge here.

904;11qgexf;"The ""one sec"" app has helped me with my senseless TikTok use";"**PREFACE |** This is *not* an advertisement. I came across this app a few weeks ago and have really found it to help my screen time. I wanted to share it with other ladies like myself who may really struggle with senseless scrolling like I do. <newline>  <newline> **INTRO |** Hi guys, I really really struggle with senseless TikTok scrolling. I've tried the ""screen time"" and ""limits"" provided with the iPhone and would always shut it off. My issue with iPhone-provided screen time, is it would interrupt mid-tiktok to lock me out, and then I'd extend it out of spite. My wasted time had gotten really bad, and I felt guilty about scrolling but have been having a rough time lately and need some time to decompress throughout the day. I found One Sec and it's helped me become more cognizant. <newline>  <newline> **ABOUT |** One sec is a free app with the option of monthly, yearly (single and family), & life-time memberships that offers student discounts and discounts to those who are financially limited. The base-app has no ads. To set up, you open one sec and you're met with a tutorial that guides you through selecting which app(s) you'd like it to work with, how to set up an automation (iPhone), and how you'd like the app to work.  <newline>  <newline> The base-app allows you to pair it with 1 app. When you open the selected app, you are rerouted to a 6 sec breathing exercise, which ends with the number of attempted used, length of time since last use, and if you'd like to continue to your chosen app. The idea is that you recognize your intent before continuing to an app that may result in high distraction. <newline>  <newline> **MY USE |** I used the free base version for several weeks before buying the lifetime membership for 40 USD.  I paired the closing of ""one sec"" with an automation that sets a 7-minute timer that helps me limit my TikTok use, but doesn't totally interrupt the flow. The paid version allows you to link several apps, change the type of reroute screen (blank, mirror, breathe, more), change the length of time for the reroute screen to stay visible, and I'm sure more that I can't remember. I lengthened the delay-screen time to 10 seconds right away. <newline>  <newline> **MEMBERSHIP TYPES** <newline>  <newline> * FREE: 0 USD  <newline> * Monthly: 4 USD <newline> * Annual Single: 15 USD (7.5 USD w/ university email, must apply for discount first) <newline> * Annual Family: 25 USD <newline> * Lifetime: 40 US <newline> * Discounts for financially disadvantaged (not sure what the requirements are)";Ninjallammas;False;2;0.8;2023-03-13 17:51:26;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11qgexf/the_one_sec_app_has_helped_me_with_my_senseless/;adhdwomen

909;11ptbrj;My financial mess (and not telling my partner about my debt...twice) may have destroyed my relationship + some major self-loathing going on tonight;"Sorry for the rambly wall of text! A few bits of context: I'm a teacher and have been with my partner for 10.5 years, 8 of those years having lived together. I got diagnosed February 2022 <newline>  <newline> At the end of the 2020-2021 school year, I was already struggling to manage my credit card debt, and not getting paid at the end of the summer made it even harder to manage my finances. I took out high-interest loans that would accept my credit score and this snowballed into about $10,000 in debt I could barely pay the monthly payments for. Why? Living beyond my means seeking the dopamine (impulse Target trips to 'treat myself', going out for drinks, food delivery, 'oh this espresso machine will be a game changer and will TOTALLY save me money and stop me from going to Starbucks so often', lolol), meanwhile keeping this entirely from my partner the whole time.  <newline>  <newline> I took a look at my financial situation one weekend and started panicking, eventually telling my boyfriend where I was at financially. He was quite pissed (understandably so) that I hadn't told him about this before I got myself into more trouble, asking why someone so smart could be such an idiot with money and sharing that it was more the withholding of information than the money that he was upset about. I didn't want any financial help from him and told him I'd figure out a plan for paying it off on my own by reaching out to my creditors, but he transferred me most of the money I needed to pay off my debts and I paid off the remaining 1/3 of my balances when I got my first paycheck for my new teaching position. I tried to refuse it and didn't want him to feel obligated, but he said he loved me and wanted to help me get back to a good place so I could have a fresh start. He did share ""I'm not doing this again, so this can't happen again. If it happens again we're done"". <newline>  <newline> .... <newline>  <newline> Well, many out of pocket teaching expenses, one neuropsych test, thousands of dollars in blood tests and imaging on a high deductible insurance plan while getting what I now know is an autoimmune condition diagnosed, lots of small impulse coffee/wine/clothing purchases while chasing the dopamine high, and way too many food deliveries when flaring or lazy (or both) and I don't want to cook...and I'm back in debt, even worse than I was before. Way too much credit card and loan debt, about 8,000 in unpaid medicals bills, and overutilization of BNPL apps like Affirm and Klarna. Why am I the way that I am?! Why didn't I learn the first time?! What's wrong with me?! I'm SO mad at myself. <newline>  <newline> I honestly have no idea why at any point the SECOND time around I never felt like I could go to my partner and say ""I'm in a really difficult place and I just want to be transparent about how much money I owe"". Guilt that he gave me so much money to help me out the first time? Knowing that it could be the end of the relationship if he found out I was in debt again? <newline>  <newline> I recognized I needed to fix this, for my financial wellbeing and to save my relationship, and talked with a credit counselor a few weeks ago who helped me enroll in credit counseling and a debt management program, still while being too embarrassed to tell my partner. I'll be paying $500 each month for 24  months until I've paid off my balances, finally free of these insane interest rates. I'll be able to actually afford my other living expenses, too, since I'm on a biologic that has a copay card that covers the full cost of my medication while counting its contribution toward my deductible. I have one credit card open that I'm going to try not to touch unless absolutely necessary, like when I need to stay out of town to proctor standardized tests next month. I make my first payment when I get paid next week and am so happy to finally be taking steps toward getting to and staying in a better place financially. <newline>  <newline>  I should have anticipated what was about to happen and I'm honestly dumbfounded that it didn't happen at any other point since this second massive debt snowball began. <newline>  <newline> Last night, my boyfriend and I booked hotel rooms for a road trip to Florida in a few weeks to see my mother, brothers, and my grandparents who aren't doing well health-wise. We thought it would be fun to do a road trip together rather than flying and both have the time off, spring break for me and saved up time off for him! After the rooms were booked, he went ""Hey, make sure you turn on travel protection on your bank's dashboard for when we'll be gone! Let me show you how"". I went ""I'll just do it tomorrow, it's okay!"".....realizing that when I signed into my bank website he'd see I had a balance of -2 in my dashboard. He went ""Wait....you just don't want me to see your bank balance, right? I know what's happening here""  <newline>  <newline> I started crying and spilled everything...telling him about all of my new debt and that I was starting a debt management program to get a handle on it all. I insisted that I had a plan and that I did not want him to send me any money this time around. I expressed how sorry I was but knew I didn't deserve to be forgiven this time, basically committing financial infidelity for the second time. <newline>  <newline> He was livid, saying he was in disbelief I let this happen again, feeling betrayed that from November 2021 to now I had withheld all of this from him again, calling himself an idiot for not realizing I'd just do it again, and just how hurt he was in general. He then said ""Ok here's the thing. I don't trust you AT ALL. I think you're a liar. I can't even look at you right now since I don't even know who you are anymore or which person I'm getting when you talk to me since obviously our relationship is a lie. I don't believe a word you say about 'having a plan' because you're honestly just probably going to do it again. Call your mom about paying for a plane ticket for you because the thought of sitting with you in a car for 8 hours each day in two weeks makes me sick but you obviously can't pay for it yourself. You have two choices: make me able to see where your money goes into/comes out of so I can see what you're spending money on....or you can leave. Idk, find another apartment or something if that's your choice. But since you obviously weren't transparent about things after the first time it happened, you need to be starting right now or this relationship is done."" I've never heard him talk like that and have never seen him that hurt, but honestly I deserve it all and then some.  <newline>  <newline>  I came up with a plan for being transparent with my finances, ran it by him, he said ""yeah sure whatever"", but now he can't even look at me and doesn't want to talk to me. I want to commit to being honest, PROVE to him he can trust me, and continue to share my life with him but it really seems like he might just be done. I want to do anything I can do to show him I'm willing to work on this but I think my relationship might be over. I asked him ""This might sound really manipulative but do you still love me, even after all this?"" He couldn't answer and just said ""The answer depends on if I can trust you or not, and I don't know what to tell you about that right now"" <newline>  <newline> I guess I'm realizing now that even aside from the ADHD, I might actually suck as a person. Does anyone else feel that way sometimes?  I promise I'm not fishing for sympathy here, I've just been asking myself ""Wait am I actually a bad person?"" all day long. I've hurt someone I genuinely care about, possibly to the point of ruining our relationship. I've struggled socially most of my life, always feeling like people thought my personality was too weird to want to be around and always feeling like the odd one out in 'friend groups'. I did see a post either on here or on Tiktok about how us  neurodivergent folks can seem a little off-putting to neurotypical people, which struck a chord with me at the time. Now I can't stop wondering if my difficulties socially and apparent inability to be a good partner are just me, not the ADHD, and mean there's nothing about me that makes me worth getting to know or love. Part of me feels like it's irrational and fueled by a lack of sleep last night and emotions and part of me is convinced it's true. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> TL:DR: I was dishonest about my debt (medical, credit card, loans) to my long-time boyfriend on two occasions, may have ruined our relationship, and have doubts I'm a good person at all at this point";an_anonymous_axolotl;False;5;0.84;2023-03-12 23:22:55;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11ptbrj/my_financial_mess_and_not_telling_my_partner/;adhdwomen
910;11pk0x2;All my hobbies include phone usage;Hello! I've been diagnosed and medicated only for a few months now. It's going alright, I've got great focus and really started getting into my interests more. But it all seems to be on my phone.  <newline> Online chess, speed cubing (tracking times and follow scrambles) learning to draw (either following videos, or copying pictures from my phone), learning to play the piano (with youtube) and I'm basically just sitting in my bed all day staring at a phone even though I'm practicing skills I'mquite proud of.  <newline>  <newline> I'm quite content in the moment but physically of course I'm still sitting and do too much screen time. <newline> And I know I can do all those things in real life. I can draw in nature or in a museum. I can go and play chess with real people. But I'm afraid the actual appeal of my chosen hobbies is the fact that it's on my phone! <newline> I've spent all my childhood playing video games, especially on my game boy and it seems I'm back at it. The only person I ever really hang out with is my boyfriend and the kids I work with. My social skills have declined massively since the pandemic and I genuinely just don't have the motivation to go back to it. I'm satisfied with my hobbies and deeply unhappy at the same time. And I believe it comes from my lack of movement, awful sitting position all day and no social life. Plus I only work part time so financially it's also a little stressful and all my money goes into bills and private adhd meds + follow up appointments. <newline> I read about the trick to turn the screen grey but I've done that before and hated it and will still use the phone l day. I'm so deep into my attachment to my phone, I don't want to make it boring on purpose. I need help!

914;11osqxh;i just did, and am doing the most ADHD thing.;I've been paralyzed in bed all morning, just scrolling through FB videos. Around one, i was finally able to get up to clean(i put some energizing music on and it helped so much). I did some cleaning- noticed my bathroom soap was out. Went to grab new soap from laundry room, realized there was none and that i’d have to use the soap bottles in the kitchen (that have yet to be put away). <newline>  <newline> Saw the Lysol wipes could be fixed so that they’re closer to the edge of the shelf. I go to the kitchen to grab the step stool, forgot why i was there. Walked back to the laundry room, remembered why i was in the kitchen. Went back, got the step stool and organized the lysol wipes. <newline>  <newline> Then i decided to organize my shelf while i was up there. I organize, and decide to put some of the things i had up there in my closet. Finishing that, I walk back towards my bed to do some more cleaning over there and pass the bathroom. <newline>  <newline> I see that i left the medicine cabinet open, and go to close it. Noticed the empty soap bottle sitting there and then realized what i just did. Also, instead of grabbing the soap right then, i decided to sit down and write a note about how i just did that. Guess i gotta go get that soap now. <newline>  <newline> TLDR: Was cleaning and noticed i needed to change soap bottle: did 10 other things before realizing i never got the soap bottle. <newline>  <newline> Edit: i got distracted by discord but i just got up and realized i still hadn't closed the medicine cabinet doors;WorldlinessGone;False;3;1.0;2023-03-11 19:29:14;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11osqxh/i_just_did_and_am_doing_the_most_adhd_thing/;adhdwomen

Based on my experience and research I’m like 99% sure I have ADHD. I’m so sick of constantly having no energy or motivation, feeling guilty and anxious for having no motivation, and just not being able to do the things I want to do. Even my partner is worried about me because all I do when I’m home from work is watch YouTube videos. I don’t have energy for everything else.

919;11nvs43;Could I have adhd even with a successful life?;"Hi, recently a friend casually joked that I have adhd. She said that she can't keep up when I talk because my mind keeps jumping from topic to topic and that I speak really quickly when I'm excited. I brushed it off because I absolutely despise self-diagnosing but the more I thought about it the more I wondered whether she may be right. I began researching adhd symptoms but I'm a bit unsure whether my characteristics aligns with these symptoms or not. I have already reached out to a counsellor but I was hoping to get some advice on this before I meet her since it's been weighing heavily on my mind. Here are some of my characteristics: <newline>  <newline> 1. Constantly misplacing stuff: I constantly lose stuff when I put them down. (e.g. when baking I have to keep finding the flour again and again everytime I need to use it) (or when studying I keep losing my pen). Sometimes it's the opposite where I think I forgot something but I actually didn't and it gets really embarassing because my friends often help me look for the 'misplaced' item too... <newline> 2. Constantly getting lost: I have always had a horrible sense of direction since young. I get lost almost every walk to a place I'm unfamiliar with. Even for places I'm supposed to be familiar with, like my school, I've noticed it takes me a much longer time to remember where things are. Even when people try to explain directions it just doesn't click. At the same time, I have noticed that when I really put in an effort I can remember the way so I'm wondering if I just need to be more conscious and this problem will be solved. <newline> 3. Many many many thoughts: I think this is the most telling of all. I always have something on my mind, and this thought keeps jumping. I thought this was normal, but upon research I realised that it may not. For instance my mind can jump from looking at someone's pink bag -> thinking about the pink outfit i want to wear to school tomorrow -> thinking about people judging -> thinking about feminism in general and how I feel empowered wearing pink things just to make a statement to people in a matter of seconds. I'm not sure whether this is normal... but sometimes it does get really tiring because I can't ever rest well. I've noticed that the only time my thoughts stop running wild are when I use social media (tiktok) or when I play the piano /guitar, which perhaps explains why I keep spending so much time on those activities. People also have commented that I say really random things even though to me it makes perfect sense why I thought about it and I can really break down the connections my mind made if I needed to explain. <newline> 4. I fidget a lot. One particular incident scared me a little because during a conversation I was fiddling with the guitar so much unconsciously that it went completely out of tune. Even when later my friend played the guitar and we heard the strings, it didn't register in my mind that it was my fault. It was only later after a couple of minutes that I realised I had been fiddling with the strings. More generallly, I often shake my legs, spin pens, twist my rings, or fiddle with the charms on my nails particularly when people are talking. When I'm focused though, I don't think I fiddle a lot. <newline> 5. I procrastinate a lot. But again I feel like this is just a matter of discpline, because I used to be pretty disciplined when I was younger. <newline>  <newline> On the other hand, I don't quite meet other symptoms. <newline>  <newline> 1. Disorderliness. My room does get very messy at times, during periods of stress / when I'm feeling down, but this usually lasts for about a week at most before I clean it again. Do normal people have consistently clean rooms? <newline> 2. I can concentrate. Although i struggle concentrating when studying, I feel like this is more a problem of discipline because during examinations I concentrate extremely well. I have never struggled with staying focused throughtout an examination (even for 3+ hour examinations, I will rest for at most 5 minutes) <newline> 3. I am able to wait my turn. I don't mind at all waiting my turn for things. Most of the time, I enjoy the time to scroll my phone / just think in peace. <newline> 4. More generally, my life has been pretty successful. I have had consistently good grades since young and am in law school now. My social life is alright too. I have many hobbies that I am passionate about and actively pursuing. <newline>  <newline> My concern has just surfaced more because of the stress of law school. I'm worried because I can no longer tide through with procrastination. It's also been hitting me more recently that I've never reached my full potential ever since I hit 13 because I SORELY lack discipline :( many of my friends who I used to do better than academically have now surpassed me and I've always wondered whether I could have reached my full potential if only I could concentrate better, were less ""blur"", and most importantly were more disciplined. In a perhaps self comforting, selfish way, I wish I could be diagnosed with adhd just so I could finally forgive myself for being lazy and maybe get more guidance. At the same time though, as mentioned previously, I absolutely abhor self diagnosing because I feel like it's so disrespectful to people who actually have mental health conditions.

921;11n0ain;Question about impulsivity;Hi, friends. I don’t think I have ADHD, but one of my best friends does, and I read the posts here (and subscribe to an ADHD YouTube channel) to try to understand her better. She’s like a family member, so that’s the only tag that seemed appropriate. I hope I’m not breaking the rules. I don’t mean to be disrespectful in any way.  <newline>  <newline> My friend is always either on or off a diet, is always losing or gaining weight, and talks about weight and diets a lot. She knows that I have had disordered eating in the past, have worked hard to be comfortable with being fat, strive to eat in a mentally and physically nourishing way for myself, and don’t like to engage in diet talk. And yet she just excitedly told me that she’s back on intermittent fasting.  <newline>  <newline> She’s quite impulsive, and I know this is a trait many people with ADHD have. So my question is, do you think the diet and body size talk is beyond her control?  She is an extremely passionate person and very self-hating about being fat, and I wonder if the passion is just so deep she can’t contain the talk.  (She’s also very talkative.)   <newline>  <newline> Thank you in advance for any insight you can give me.;sssjjj777;False;1;1.0;2023-03-09 18:52:08;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11n0ain/question_about_impulsivity/;adhdwomen

923;11m9ra3;I’ve taken more showers in Feb than I did in 2021 + 2022;TL:DR: I realized I never felt “the good kind of” clean after a shower, adopted a new routine, now I’m obsessed with showering, because I feel so good when I’m done.  <newline>  <newline> Like so many people here, I feel like I’ve been trying so many things, to get me to bathe more often. I’ve always hated showering, and have never lived in a place with a good tub. I’ve tried nice slippers, cotton robes, silk robes, down filled robes, music, podcasts, lights, space heaters, buying whatever shower products catch my fancy. I don’t make myself wash my hair, so I have shower caps to remove that barrier.  <newline>  <newline> But it was mostly for nothing. They all added nice elements to a shower routine, but they weren’t flipping the switch. I’ve mostly done sink showers for my entire adult life. I’m getting close to 40, and I hated showering. Couldn’t put my finger on the ultimate source of discomfort.  <newline>  <newline> Then one day, the instagram algorithm showed me a self care influencer. I almost scrolled past, but this person has her shower walls covered in suction-cup shelves and bath products. And I was repulsed enough to be curious.  <newline>  <newline> Her shower routine:  <newline> 1. use exfoliating cloth (I use gloves) with bar soap all over the body. (clean off dirt and loose skin <newline> 2. She uses a silicone scrubber with body wash/shower gel (cleans and deposits some moisture) <newline>  <newline> 3. She finishes with a moisturizing sugar scrub (gets the rest of the dead skin, leaves behind moisturizing elements) <newline>  <newline> I heard the tiniest voice in my brain say, “Wow, I bet she feels SO GOOD when she gets out.” I thought about it and realized that’s my barrier, not feeling good enough to care to repeat the routine.  <newline>  <newline> Just using soap leaves me feeling squeaky, just using gel leaves me feeling scummy, and I used to start my showers with a sugar scrub, then wash away all those oils. I adopted this influencer’s sequence, and I have showered near daily for almost a month. I’ve taken cold showers, because I know I’ll feel so good afterwards, that I can brave the temperatures. I’ve even done two showers in a day, because they feel so restorative. And I’ve gone from 6-8 weeks between hair washes to 6-8 days.  <newline>  <newline> I hope this helped a couple people.;HedsyZebsy;False;9;0.99;2023-03-08 22:07:47;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11m9ra3/ive_taken_more_showers_in_feb_than_i_did_in_2021/;adhdwomen

925;11m0lm1;I feel like I've found my tribe!;"I'm new here, and thought I would introduce myself. It took me at least a month (maybe much longer) to even consider that I could possibly have ADHD at 53 years old. In the last 5 years or so, I have really struggled with depression and anxiety, plus I am a tightly-wound ball of stress over the tiniest things. Also, I can't just DO THE THINGS.  My 20 year old son actually has been suggesting it for a while, and is on a waiting list to be tested himself.  For a while through Covid, I was even having a hard time getting out of bed, and really couldn't enjoy anything. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in September, and immediately changed my diet, lost 30 lbs, hyperfocused on checking my blood sugar to the point where I got a CGM, and reduced my A1C to 5.2 (normal range) in 3 months. Now I am able to get out of bed and have more energy, but I still couldn't focus on DOING THE THINGS. My boyfriend of ten years left me right before Thanksgiving, and I think a lot of it had to do with my ADHD symptoms. He used to get so angry that I would blurt out answers or try to finish his sentences before he was done asking them, and always would stop when I interrupted him and say, ""I am not going to tell you, because you can't let me speak.""  He would get so angry about it and tell me I was doing it on purpose and basically being a dick. In my head, my interrupting was showing him that I was listening to what he was saying instead of zoning out (as I tend to do) and that I was interested in the conversation, and excited to participate. Once I started looking into ADHD and read a lot of the symptoms, I cried. I am still feeling really emotional thinking that if I had been diagnosed earlier, my life would have been so different, and how much have I lost, and is it too late for me at this age? I think I must be in perimenopause or menopause even, but I don't know for sure because I still have a Mirena and haven't had periods for 20 years basically. (Except for a few months about 12 years ago when I decided not to get a new one just to make sure my plumbing was working properly... a novelty that wore off pretty quickly and I got a new IUD after about 2 months. <newline>  <newline> I have been treated for depression, anxiety, insomnia and CPTSD (from my childhood. I was put into foster care at 7, and there is a lot of trauma around it all.) I have always been intelligent, but told I don't apply myself. I was the girl in school who never started a project until the night before it was due, no matter how complex it was. I managed to mostly get decent grades, except in history, where I couldn't memorize the dates and facts and names, or keep the stories straight in my head. I was interested, I just couldn't remember the details later, so I failed history a couple of time or got a D and was told I wasn't working up to my potential. I also dropped out of college toward the end of my freshman year, due to multiple reasons involving stress and anxiety. <newline>  <newline> So I really started considering this about two weeks ago and talked to my therapist about it last week. I had a psychiatrist appointment yesterday that had been scheduled since last June as a follow-up, and I brought it up with her. She agreed with my therapist (who isn't qualified to actually diagnose) and me, and has adjusted my meds. I have been taking  .2 mg Clonidine at night for PTSD nightmares and insomnia, and now I am adding .05 mg in the morning for a week, and .05 mg in the afternoon starting next week (if I don't get drowsy or dizzy.) She also increased my Effexor from 175 mg to 225 mg.  I have congenital high blood pressure (since my 20s, and losing weight did not make a difference in that) and a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (which I luckily DO NOT have) but she didn't want to put me on a stimulant for those reasons. I also am used to a heart rate in the 60s, and I get really uncomfortable if my heart rate is 80+ unless I am exercising.  I plan to try Ginkgo biloba in addition to these changes, and will see how it goes. Also, just being self-aware has made a huge difference. I have been making lists in my planner every day, and although I know I am putting too many things on the list and need to carry some over, I feel really good when I can check something off. And it's not just ""do laundry,"" it's, ""laundry in washer, laundry in dryer, FOLD laundry,"" as I am trying to avoid washing one load multiple times because I left it wet for a day or two, or having everything wrinkled because I left it smashed up in the basket for a week. <newline>  <newline> As you might be able to tell, my mind is always overactive, and so is my mouth. I am making changes, but just seeing that I am not the only one, even though it still makes me cry, makes me feel so much better. I have been following Alice of ""the Mini ADHD Coach"" on instagram and her comics resonate so much with me that they make me cry too. My boyfriend (I still can't bring myself  to call him ex yet) took me out to dinner the other night and helped me fill out the workbook. I do think he still loves me, and I hope maybe we can work it out some day. The stress of my 20 year old son still living at home (and who might also have ADHD) didn't help our relationship either. <newline>  <newline> Phew, that was a lot.

927;11kxe5a;Anyone feeling ignored/not listened too during assessment process?;Hi, (31f) recently diagnosed by psychologist (I’m in Australia). Trying to get on medication, I have to get reassessed by a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 18 (which my psychologist & myself believe was a misdiagnosis) but I have found that the psychiatrist I’ve just seen isn’t willing to even take into account any other symptoms and has just jumped to an anxiety condition and mood disorder.  <newline>  <newline> My symptoms all perfectly align with ADHD (including rejection sensitivity disorder) and I have had symptoms from childhood - I have just managed to learn how to live with them relatively ok. I first investigated the diagnosis because of a TikTok video which I recognised discussed all symptoms I’d been dealing with for years. This psychiatrist wasn’t interested in any of my discussions and basically wrote me off because of my previous diagnosis. He even made a comment about ‘seeing the diagnosis on social media and getting on a bandwagon’.  <newline>  <newline> Has anyone else experienced this? How did you manage it?

933;11jby6a;Overwhelmed with hairstyling;"Hey, <newline>  <newline> This might be a tad bit long - I'm not sure yet. I need to give a little bit of a backstory, I suppose - so, my mother is half Puerto Rican and she has curly, Spanish hair. However, she was adopted by a white family and I think they didn't really take any time to learn how to treat her hair. She never really knew, nor does she know now, how to do anything more than a ponytail. Growing up, my aunts were the ones that would braid my hair and style it. When we grew distant from my aunts and I was more of a teenager in control with my hair - I just kind of left it as is. Just my hair - but brushed (usually). My oldest sister would sometimes do buns, my middle sister had the fluffiest hair ever and never really knew what to do with it other than a ponytail. Eventually, she shaved it. I am now the only one in my family with long hair - besides my mom, who also just usually leaves her hair as is. <newline>  <newline> As of now the only thing I feel I can successfully do is ponytails and I've had increasing anxiety and overwhelmingness surrounding doing anything with my hair. My husband is black and only just recently cut off his dreads - so for three years, he had long hair and would style it in different buns and hairstyles. He has tried in the past to suggest me to try buns and whatnot. I would start to try - watch a video or read an article, try a few times and when I wouldn't get it, I would give up. It's like, if I don't get it in less than four shots, it's too overwhelming and I give up. Watching videos, I always feel like I miss some steps, but reading articles always feels like I'm missing something. Sometimes I just feel like some women have some sort of magic that allows them to just get it and style their hair. I feel like I'm missing that and I don't know if it's just because of how I grew up, or if maybe ADHD is involved as well? I know I tend to give up easily and I generally attribute that to ADHD and my lack of patience and inability to accept that I'm not perfect. I like to just ""get"" things and do things my way. I struggle with reading directions and often just try to do it myself - but then I usually end up with overly spiced food, or a chair that doesn't stay together, or a hair style that looks straight out of a yearbook photo for Wacky Hair Wednesdays. <newline>  <newline> Today, my husband and I were experimenting with hairclips because it seems like something EASY. We watched a Tiktok over and over again and I tried to replicate and I just...didn't get it successfully and I ended up crying. I don't know. A part of me feels like hair is an essential part of womanhood and I missed out when I was a child because I didn't have many girl friends and once we became distant from my aunt, I had nobody to ask or help me through those steps and it feels deeply embarrassing at 25 to ask my friends for help doing a bun or braiding my hair. So I don't know if it's trauma, ADHD, or OCD or a mix of all - or something. I just feel so...overwhelmed by hair so I procrastinate doing anything and just continue with just brushing it and getting by. <newline>  <newline> Yet still, every now and then I want to mix it up and surprise my husband. Or just be like other women? And yet I feel like I can't. I just get frustrated, overwhelmed, and upset. So I give up and stop trying.  <newline>  <newline> I just want to know if anyone else struggles similarly? I feel so alone and so silly for being so deeply upset by this.";TheWhisperedthing;False;2;1.0;2023-03-05 20:19:25;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11jby6a/overwhelmed_with_hairstyling/;adhdwomen

943;11gcx2n;30F, diagnosed today with ADHD;Hi all, I've been lurking for the past 3 weeks or so, I haven't talked to anyone else after my final appointment today but I was diagnosed with ADHD.  Well, a provisional diagnosis.  <newline>  <newline> After 3 long appointments, going through screenings and tests, doc said some childhood symptoms are not clear, but she thinks that my culture (I'm Latina, child of immigrant parents) has a lot to do with that. My mom was so organized, super clean and had the highest of expectations for me and my siblings. She structured everything. I did pretty good in school, until I was left to my own devices and I didn't realize how much I relied on my twin and my mom to get assignments done.  <newline>  <newline> I tried community College and tried, tried my best. Honestly, very tired of how much I had to try to make anything work really. But I started classes strong, then would start falling and falling behind. Staying up all night trying to learn the most basic math (Math 70), just to barely pass. I changed majors twice before dropping out and joining the army. In the Army, it was easier, except being on time to places once I was out of my training and (surprise), left to my own devices. Somehow all my sergeants, first line supervisors and even captain, liked me so much, they let small things slide, like being late, disorganized, a messy barrack room and I loved the job (medic). So again I continued to slide by life and looking back, that's what it was like, just sliding by. I've tried college like 6 times, still no degree.  <newline>  <newline> I had some anxiety issues after the army but work was not too hard after my time as a medic. Things like forgetting to do stuff for people, cleaning my house, paying bills and what not were always an issue for me but my husband was super helpful and I guess picked up so much of my slack, that none of that really bothered me.  <newline>  <newline> It wasn’t until having my first son (2018) that I began to really notice my symptoms and then proceed to feel like I was trying to catch up and never actually caught up on anything. My family would visit and notice how extra forgetful I was, how distracted how organized but I chalked it off to mom brain. Then I had my second kid (2021) and everything was so overwhelming. My husband also had depression issues and wasn't helping with the house. I started to feel it even more. I started the day, every day, with the intention to clean, but could never decide what to clean first or would start in the kitchen, find myself in the living room picking toys up instead and by the end of the day, nothing was done, just half piles of stuff that just got bigger and bigger.  <newline>  <newline> For some reason I had the urge to start a podcast in 2020 and now have 3 and that's the only hobby I've kept that long but before that, I always wasted money starting things I never finish. My credit card is embarrassing, we payed it off in 2021 and then I went and added too much on it again. I kept losing important things. I just felt like a mess, like I should be able to be an adult but I couldn’t. Like I shouldn't be responsible for the life of two kids because I couldn’t do anything right. I just felt like I was constantly letting everyone down.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway my husband started sending me adhd tiktoks that I was relating to too much and I suspected it for a while before I finally brought it up to my PCP. She did a short screening, referred me to the psychD that works in the same clinic and 2 months later, here we are. I have an appointment in two weeks to discuss medications and then another one in a month to start therapy as well.  <newline>  <newline> I cried when I received the diagnosis. I guess I just always felt like something was wrong with me, like why didn't I try more, why didn't I care more, lots of feelings. I don't know what the point of this post is, just feeling emotional and kinda have no one else to talk to.  <newline>  <newline> Tl:DR- I was diagnosed today at 30 and feel lots of emotions right now. But I think I'm relieved too.;cristinanana;False;6;1.0;2023-03-02 20:23:27;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11gcx2n/30f_diagnosed_today_with_adhd/;adhdwomen
944;11fkhjm;This take on ADHD is refreshing. It may be paradigm changing for me.;"I'm almost into my fourth year existing with a formal diagnosis of Inattentive ADHD. I take Daytrana (a methylphenidate patch) and it works pretty well, but I still struggle quite a bit with executive dysfunction. I work in a STEM field which requires me to make judgement calls and manage things and I just...can't...do it well. I come out looking very immature more often than I'd like. I am almost completely convinced I have a nasty case of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. I'm sure that growing up in a narcissistic family didn't help things. What's more is that I have Seasonal Affective Disorder. It's pretty much a given that during the winter I am barely holding onto life a lot of the time. <newline>  <newline> I work from home and keep YouTube or something along those lines on for background noise. Today I was especially down on myself so I decided to do some research on RSD. What I found was pretty cool. My apologies if someone else has posted about this before, I couldn't find any evidence of it. <newline>  <newline> Arguably one of the quagmires of having ADHD is simply being labeled as a person with ADHD. It's a ""disorder"", it's ""hyperactive"" (I'm not!), and the conventional wisdom is that those with it have serious problems. What isn't mentioned is that those with ADHD are gifted with talents that others do not have. <newline>  <newline> Two respected psychiatrists have a BIG problem with this. They find that the condition should be named something else. And they back up their point well enough that I was able to identify with it. I almost never self-congratulate.

I used the information and started writing things down and I'm rolling with it. <newline>  <newline> So I introduce you to the acronym V.A.S.T.: ""Variable Attention Stimulus Trait"".

947;11ec409;How to make your phone ADHD friendly;"I use my phone everyday, for several hours a day. <newline>  <newline> I found myself thinking that my phone was just a distraction, rather than a tool I can use to help and structure my everyday life. <newline>  <newline> Just like I've made an effort into making something like my home ADHD friendly, I believe that doing the same to my phone is just as important.  <newline>  <newline> Doing this has been incredibly helpful to me, so I wanted write a post sharing some tips and tricks if you want to do the same. <newline>  <newline> Feel free to post your own tips in the comments, and I'll add it to the list if you consent to it! <newline>  <newline> **Declutter your phone** <newline>  <newline> If you're anything like me and have a phone packed with useless apps, screenshots, old photos, etc. It might take a while, but go though your phone and delete anything unnecessary. <newline>  <newline> If you want to make your phone ADHD friendly, starting with a clean slate is an important first step. <newline>  <newline> How to see and delete unused apps on [Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-quickly-find-and-delete-unused-applications-on-android-13/) and [iPhone](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/05/22/delete-unused-apps/) <newline>  <newline> Overall guide as to how to free up space on [iPhone](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/free-up-your-iphone-storage-with-these-simple-tricks/) and [Android](https://www.mobilefun.co.uk/blog/2015/04/how-to-increase-storage-space-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet/). <newline>  <newline> **Organize your apps** <newline>  <newline> Structure is important for us with ADHD, the same goes for your phone! <newline>  <newline> There are many ways to organize your apps, so try it out and see what works best for you. <newline>  <newline> - Having folders for different types of apps. Like one for social media, one for games, work related, etc. <newline> - Organize your apps so that your most useful apps are easy to open and your distracting apps are hidden. <newline> - Organize your apps per page. For example, on your first page you have apps you need quick access to, second you have tools/settings apps, third games, etc. <newline>  <newline> You can find how to organize your phone on both Android and iPhone [here](https://www.aarp.org/home-family/personal-technology/info-2021/how-to-organize-apps.html) <newline>  <newline>  <newline> **Turn off unnecessary notifications**  <newline>  <newline> Turn off any notifications that aren't absolutely necessary, the goal is to have as few notifications as possible. <newline>  <newline> If you get an important text message from your boss that you should answer right away, but you also see a notification from a mobile game, an online store letting you know they're having a sale right now, and one from reddit showing a post with a very interesting title, the important text message will be the last thing on your ADHD mind. <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-notification-settings-iph7c3d96bab/ios) and [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en) <newline>  <newline> **Make your notifications visible** <newline>  <newline> Some people have their notifications set up so rather than showing what the notification is about, like the content of a text message, it shows just the text message icon on the lock screen instead. <newline>  <newline> People do this for privacy reasons, but for most of us with ADHD, we need ""in your face"" type of information and reminders for it to register and work for us. <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925) ""Change how notification appear"" and [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en) under ""Show all notifications"". <newline>  <newline> **Snooze notifications** <newline>  <newline> You see a text message from your friend that you should respond to, but you're busy at the moment, so you'll answer it as soon as you're available. But then you forget about it and the message stays unanswered until your now annoyed friend reminds you about it. <newline>  <newline> *Sounds familiar?* <newline>  <newline> You can actually set up your phone so it ""snoozes"" notifications from certain apps, meaning that they re-send unopened notifications until you open it. I use this for apps like Whatsapp and messenger, and I've gotten much better at responding since then. <newline>  <newline> I have an android, on my phone I can go in to settings and pick certain apps that will be snoozed automatically. After doing some research, it looks like you can't do this on IPhone. However, you can still pick to snooze notifications on your lock screen. Correct me if I'm wrong! <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [Android](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-snooze-notifications-individual-apps-android/) and [iPhone](https://www.howtogeek.com/243386/how-to-snooze-or-reply-to-notifcations-from-the-iphone%E2%80%99s-lock-screen/amp/) <newline>  <newline> **Do Not Disturb** <newline>  <newline> I listen to podcasts when I'm cleaning, and the sound of notifications in my headphones make me distracted. So I put my phone on silent. <newline>  <newline> Then I forget to put my phone off silent, and then I'm met with missed calls and messages because of it. Or even better, I lose my phone and ask somebody to call it, only to find out that's impossible because of phone is on silent. <newline>  <newline> I've tried to look up how to change the settings so your notifications are on silent but calls are not, but I haven't managed to figure that out yet. If anyone knows how, please let me know! <newline>  <newline> What I've started doing is using Do Not Disturb. <newline>  <newline> Do Not Disturb and I didn't get along at first. Same thing there, I put it on, forgot to turn it off, and met with what felt like hundreds of missed calls and angry messages. <newline>  <newline> But when I changed the settings a bit, we went from enemies to lovers. <newline>  <newline> If you go on the do not disturb settings, they have a bunch of different settings you can use to make it ADHD friendly. <newline>  <newline> For example, I have it set up so repeat callers and favorite contacts can still call me, alarms, reminders and calender events will still come through. If I'm waiting  for an important message from a certain app, I'm putting that app as an exception too. <newline>  <newline> But my favorite one of all, is that I have it set up so my phone asks me the duration of ""do not disturb"" everytime I put it on.  <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9069335?hl=en) and [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321) <newline>  <newline> **Do Not Disturb pt.2 - Sleeping**  <newline>  <newline> Most people with ADHD also have sleeping issues. While this hack won't magically cure insomnia, having ""Do not Disturb - Sleeping"" scheduled on your phone certainly helps. <newline>  <newline> Here, you can set up a schedule so Do not Disturb automatically turns on during a specific time of your choice. You can also make exceptions with certain contacts, apps, etc. So you don't have to worry about missing anything important while getting a good, unnecessary notification free, night's sleep! <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [Android](https://www.maketecheasier.com/android-do-not-disturb-mode/) and [iPhone](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-enable-do-not-disturb-at-bedtime-on-iphone/) <newline>  <newline> **Widgets** <newline>  <newline> Remember what I said us ADHDers need ""in your face"" kind of information? Widgets were built for us! <newline>  <newline> With widgets, you can choose all kinds of apps to show information amongst other things directly on your home screen. <newline>  <newline> For example, I have a Widget showing how much time I've spent on my phone today. Since I tend to get hyperfocused and lose track of time, this reminds me that it's time to put down my phone. <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122) and [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9450271?hl=en#zippy=%2Cadd-or-resize-a-widget) under ""Add or resize a widget"". <newline>  <newline> **Change alarm sounds** <newline>  <newline> Like many of you can probably relate to, I have huge issues with getting up in the morning. <newline> My therapist suggested that I change my alarm into something, and I quote, ""absolutely awful, Chernobyl nuclear, loud and impossible to ignore type of sound"". <newline>  <newline> This change, combined with having my phone on charge away from the bed so I have to get up to turn it off, made the world of a difference for me. Try it out if you have the same issues! <newline>  <newline> The default alarm sounds doesn't do the job. Instead, download an app where you can download other ringtones instead.  <newline>  <newline> I used an app called Zedge, here's links to the app on [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zedge.android) and [appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1086101495?pt=1393449&ct=1st_fold&mt=8). <newline>  <newline> **Check your alarm settings** <newline>  <newline> While making my phone ADHD friendly, I explored the alarms app and found some helpful settings that I didn't know of. <newline>  <newline> For example: <newline>  <newline> - Change the snoozing duration. <newline> - Have your alarm increase volume gradually. <newline> - Volume and power button shortcuts (So when you press those it can either snooze the alarm, dismiss it, or do nothing). I'm mentioning this since the default settings on my phone was ""dismiss"", turning it off made it harder for me to just click the button and go back to sleep. <newline> - Pick if your alarm should be silenced after a certain amount of time or not. <newline>  <newline> I have an Android, and I didn't find anything about if iPhone has similar settings or not. So iPhone users, let me know if that's a thing or not! <newline>  <newline> Here's how to change your alarm settings on [Android](https://support.google.com/clock/answer/2841106?hl=en) under ""Change alarm settings"" and [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207512) <newline>  <newline> **Unsubscribe from free trials on apps immediately** <newline>  <newline> Okay, this is slightly unrelated to the topic at hand. But since we're discussing ADHD and phones, I feel like it's worth mentioning. <newline>  <newline> Everytime you do a free trial on an app, go on the playstore/appstore and unsubscribe right away. <newline>  <newline> You will still be able to enjoy your free trial, and this way you won't forget to unsubscribe before the free trial is over. <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [Android](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) and [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) <newline>  <newline> **Can't stop making impulsive purchases on apps?** <newline>  <newline> Remove your credit card from the appstore/playstore. <newline>  <newline> If you tend to do impulsive purchases on your phone, then this is the best way to go. <newline>  <newline> It's way too easy to make an impulsive purchase on your phone. Click a button, use your fingerprint, done.  <newline>  <newline> This way, you have to put in your credit card info again if you want to make a purchase. Making it so you have a second to think if this is actually necessary, rather than the purchase being just one click away. <newline>  <newline> Here's how to do it on [Android](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/4646404?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) and [iPhone] (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203905). <newline>  <newline> **App suggestion - Sweepy** <newline>  <newline> I've tried a lot of ADHD friendly app, but this is the only one I've tried that I absolutely love. <newline>  <newline> Sweepy is an app that helps you organize and structure your cleaning schedule. <newline>  <newline> You set up chores that needs to be done room by room. Sweepy gives you suggestions on chores and how often they should be done, but you can customize this yourself. <newline>  <newline> Sweepy reminds you when it's time to clean, and you can also setup a daily reminder and pick the notification time yourself. <newline>  <newline> One thing that I like about the app is that you can get unlock achievements!  <newline> Something about getting an achievement in the app when I cleaned the other day made cleaning actually fun. I found myself doing more chores just to get an achievement lol. <newline>  <newline> They also have a streak system, but you can turn this off in settings if it stresses you out. <newline>  <newline> The app is free, with the option to have a premium version with a monthly subscription. The main benefit of using the premium version is that you can share your cleaning schedule with others without any additional fees. So the free version works just fine. <newline>  <newline> I highly recommend this app, download it and try it out yourself! <newline>  <newline> You can find Sweepy here on [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.sweepy.sweepy) and [appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sweepy-home-cleaning-schedule/id1498897320).";toocritical55;False;2;1.0;2023-02-28 15:56:41;/r/adhdwomen/comments/11ec409/how_to_make_your_phone_adhd_friendly/;adhdwomen
948;11dy527;Does anyone else have internalised rules for themselves when it comes to social situations?;"What are your internal monologues when you meet people/struggle with rejection sensitivity/ socialise? What helps you navigate friendships? <newline>  <newline>  Some examples of mine: <newline>  <newline> - I once heard someone say, if you get interrupted and no one asks to come back to what you were saying, they weren't interested so let it go. This helps me. <newline> - People say, ""Why can kids just go up to random and make friends"" and I thought - I can be brave too! If I feel I connect with someone, in a super low pressure way I make the first move to swap details/ organise an outing. I've found a whole bunch of us are all waiting for someone else to make the first move, so I try to be that someone.... but SUPER low pressure. Example- Here's my name on Messenger, if you're keen to connect feel free to look me up! If they don't, I leave it. <newline> -  I will be the first to contact 2-3 times for new friends, and a higher number for people I know better, but then it's up to them to connect. If they don't, no hard feelings, but I'm not going to waste my time with RS stressing about if they like me or I'm annoying them, I'll just let it fade no hard feelings. <newline> - If I get that intrusive thought ""I'm talking too much"" I don't sweat it, but I make sure my next turn to talk is asking them a question about themselves or their opinions <newline> - I notice the person who is on the outside of the group and do my best to draw them into conversation (unless they're giving signals they'd rather not), and try to find a topic they're passionate about to bring into the conversation. I know how it feels to be on the outside. <newline>  <newline> I overthink EVERYTHING and I am aware I am masking hardcore, but because I'm so conscious of being ""annoying"" I have a whole bunch of guidelines I give myself.

949;11doz6v;Deciding to get assessed for adhd;Two years ago in my last year of uni deeply frustrated with myself and wanting my degree to be over I realised I could have adhd everything I read about it fit me perfectly.

But if I don’t have adhd that means nothing changes and I have to continue trying to figure out my problems more or less alone :( also getting diagnosed in new zealand is a very long and costly process. I try not to think about it too much because fixating on it doesn’t get me anywhere, but to make things worse instagram has figured out my concerns and keeps showing me adhd content which I can’t help relating to - and I know instagram reels are vague and relatable to reach a wide audience, wondering how many neurotypical people also relate to these reels?

I've been through several rounds of decluttering (thanks to the decluttering sub). I never understood what ""cleaning"" meant though.  <newline>  <newline> A few weeks ago, I stumbled across Midwest Magic Cleaning on youtube. Something clicked in my brain. I cried for about 20 minutes, and then I cleaned my kitchen. And then my bathroom. Today I did my living room.

I still have the utility room and my bedroom to do, but I GET IT now, and it isn't overwhelming, and I dont lose focus or shut down out of frustration after a few minutes. I usually watch one video first, then start cleaning while I listen a second or third video.  <newline>  <newline> My house isn't perfect, and I don't expect it to be, but it's very close to ""not embarassing"" and ""I can invite people over"" levels.

955;11bxf98;How does social media use affect your ADHD symptoms?;Scrolling any social media site — Twitter, Instagram or Facebook — causes me to become irritable after only a few minutes, especially if I haven’t been on it in a while. Over the past six months, I’ve hardly looked at Twitter, and when I recently went on it again, scrolling and looking at all the tweets popping up caused me to get extremely irritable, both physically and mentally. I feel like my eyes can’t focus and my thoughts become more jumbled, which is why I stopped looking at it to begin with. I think it aggravates my memory problems as well (and I have no doubt that it also affects people who are not diagnosed with ADHD). It all feels like a mix of sensory and information overload. Too many images, too much text, too much information to absorb.  <newline>  <newline> I'm curious if others feel this way, as I think my ADHD symptoms are a factor in this.

966;zp52v2;I discovered PMDD 5 days after melting down at a truly lovely man and 2 days before seeing a GYN for BC;"I lost it at him on a Wednesday in early November, said I felt ignored and only wanted for my body. He was heartbroken, confused, distressed – and the next day I started my period and I was completely fine sans a WHOLE lot of guilt. I apologized, told him I was PMSing and didn't realize, that I was so so so so sorry and didn't believe any of those things. I still feel awful. He said he felt like he'd let me down and didn't understand what he'd done wrong or why I was so upset 😭 and I feel so awful for ever even thinking he would only use me for my body because he's not like that.  <newline>  <newline> That Sunday I clicked on a clickbait article about some TikTok lady (I think?) who just got a PMDD dx and was being open about it. I'd never heard of it. I kept reading about it and realized I needed help ASAP bc it explained why my antidepressants (trazodone) weren't working right despite upping and upping the dose. Trazodone isn't indicated as a treatment for PMDD!  <newline>  <newline> I saw my new GYN the following Tuesday, told her my suspicion of PMDD. Being suicidal until – literally – menstruation started and then being completely stable was the main ""holy shit this is bad"" symptom for me. I got so lucky, my new GYN not only knows PMDD but believed me that we needed to treat it to see if it is in fact PMDD. I went in not wanting hormonal bc but I left with estradiol and I've gone through one period since *without losing my mind*. I'm skipping the sugar pills but I bled for two weeks and the entire PMS cycle was just so normal and calm.  <newline>  <newline> All it took was hormonal bc and I'm sane again. My psychiatrist who is this old white dude from the VA *also knows PMDD* and said we'll wait to see what the BC does and if it's working, we'll come down on the trazodone (which I genuinely don't feel I need anymore since it was apparently PMDD this whole freaking time). We also switched from Adderall to Adderall XR and I feel so level and stable during the day, all day!  <newline>  <newline> Discovering PMDD and getting treatment has literally changed my life.

Even on your darkest, worst days where you can’t see the point in going on, it’s still singing. You can’t hear it, but one day you will. <newline>  <newline> I hope everyone in here can find peace, love, and happiness one day. I hope you all will be able to hear your song of hope.

Foods that are grown with the season also happen to be much tastier (and dare i say gives a zing in my brain and step). I forgot to ask my friend for a source. I used some pmdd diet sources online [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRT2deFsRz8) as a starting point. I ended up just eating fresh and listening to my body and what my body finds tasty. (And if it's non-gmo, organic, and fresh- my body has a stronger natural reaction to it). I also was fortunate to live by a chinese grocery store and everything there is super fresh and, surprisingly, grown locally (due to cheap labor).10/10 would recommend. It's intimidating because food smells and looks like food (not shiny wax stuff).  <newline>  <newline> * Blood work!

984;12k68l0;Whoopsie. Accidentally cut someone out of my life because my brain made me think they hated me.;This has happened to me... so many times. One of the most recurrent themes of my PMDD (and I'm sure many of you) is thinking my friends and associates suddenly hate me or are judgemental of me. I assume they feel about me the way I feel about myself inside. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> My closest friend at the moment, who i've only known for a couple of years, didn't respond to an invitation to hang out a couple weeks ago (I invited him to come watch the Love is Blind finale when it airs, and he just completely ignored it.). So that was kinda on him <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I have a private twitter account for only my close friends and it's also pretty obvious that he has me on mute, or just chooses not to interact with me in any way. And that twitter account is where I let off steam to people who I trust. I tweet maybe 3-4 times a day, so it's not much. He hasn't interacted with that account in probably 2+ months. But I was trying not to take it personally, I know I can be intense. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> But it was the ignoring of my invitation to hang out that really hurt my feelings.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Anyway, since then, I've just been assuming he hates me. I mean he's not giving me any indication that he LIKES me right now. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> So a couple days ago I unfriended him on my twitter account and forced him to unfollow me. I assumed our friendship was over, for whatever reason. I've been ranting to my husband about wtf my ex-friend's problem is. We were both stumped over why he'd suddenly start hating me. I was so hurt <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Today he sent me a message on my IG stories like nothing was wrong (about an unrelated thing). And I was like, whoops. I definitely read too much into all that.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> But it also made me realize he's not a super great friend. So I'll demote him to acquaintance. But he's not my enemy and he doesn't hate me. <newline>  <newline>    <newline> I've jumped the gun like this so many times though. because of my PMDD.

986;12j45mb;I feel awkward because I am like two completely different persons;Hey everyone,  <newline>  <newline> I've noticed these mood swings in the beginning of the pandemic (before I haven't had the opportunity to pay attention to myself enough to notice), and they strangely aligned with some phases of my cicle. <newline> I started to look up and read about a lot of disorders, pmdd included.  <newline>  <newline> I have never taken any hormonal pill or else, my cycle is regular and I have almost no cramps (just the first day and any painkiller can get me going). <newline>  <newline> It's just that sometimes a week before and during my period I became someone else entirely. <newline> I'm already pretty lonely and awkward, I lack some social skills, and when I'm like this I feel like there's no hope for me. I have suicide ideation, I try to quit things (two weeks ago I had a breakdown and almost quit the master I started 2 months ago), I just want to cry and not leave my bedroom. <newline>  <newline> This makes people see me in a very awkward way, like I change too much. Sometimes I'm ok and some days I won't say a word (when I'm already very quiet). <newline>  <newline> I don't even post on Instagram anymore, because when I'm feeling like I'm the worst, dumbest and ugliest person in the word I don't want to even open that app, and when I'm ok I feel like I'm lying if i post something. <newline>  <newline> I'm so tired, even today that I'm ok I fear I'll have another crisis soon, so I'm so cautious with everyone plus I'm feeling like everyone thinks I'm unbalanced because I cried over a joke and said I wanted to quit my masters. <newline>  <newline> I don't have a diagnosis, and I just started therapy to see how it'll go, maybe it's something else, like anxiety. <newline> I'm also starting to take magnesium and I'll try with b6 only during the week before my period (I'm afraid of hurting my body idk :( ). <newline>  <newline> Life is already miserable when I'm ok, I just want to feel normal. <newline>  <newline> Sorry for the vent written in bad english, I just don't have anyone to talk to.;ronnabyte;False;4;0.95;2023-04-12 00:48:42;/r/PMDD/comments/12j45mb/i_feel_awkward_because_i_am_like_two_completely/;pmdd
987;12drmro;Cold baths = my best hell week in years;"I just want to share my experience that the Wim Hof method has me feeling better than I have in years. I got my period last night and I didnt have one meltdown during PMS time. I was able to be present, truly present, with my family, not feeling the need to hide constantly and zone out in a book or a screen. I had a few very busy days and didnt end up screaming at everyone due to overstimulation. I didnt have suicidal thoughts, even once. And overall my baseline emotional level all day long was pretty good. Not perfect but not shitty, it felt like ""normal"" PMS. (for context I would say I usually have 1-3 major emotional meltdowns in the week that end up with me screaming at everyone and feeling suicidal afterwards, and my baseline emotions all week are very are depressed, drained, irritable, zoned out 24/7) <newline>  <newline> The craziest part is that I only started this a few days before hell week. Today is day 10. I havent even gotten my body fully in the water yet and it is not an ice bath just a cold water bath probably 40-45 degrees. I do this Wm Hof ""beginner"" video and then get in as far as I can and stay in as long as I can handle. So far my longest is 1 minute, shortest is 15 seconds. I am not trying to be perfect with it, just trying to do it consistently every day. I even skipped the video 1 or 2 days and just did the water (it sucked, woudlnt recommend, the breathing exercise is worth it). <newline>  <newline> Heres the video I have been using- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&ab\_channel=WimHof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&ab_channel=WimHof) <newline>  <newline> I just wanted to share this to say that if you have been thinking about trying out this method, you really should!! <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> (also for context, other things I have tried are acupuncture which has helped immensely over the last 2 years, and various supplements but I stopped taking all of them a few months ago, and Rx progesterone cream and pills which didnt work at all for me. when i started seeking treatment i was having 2 periods a month and 1-2 good days and the rest was hell week all month long)";Glittering-Mobile-51;False;15;1.0;2023-04-06 17:35:36;/r/PMDD/comments/12drmro/cold_baths_my_best_hell_week_in_years/;pmdd

992;12ad3aj;Hormone level testing;I’m just posting this TikTok which a Dr wrote about the tests that can be done on your hormone levels.   She wrote this about perimenopause but she also discusses luteal phase levels and severe pms. It may be helpful to know if you feel something may be off with your hormones that’s maybe making your symptoms worse, but you don’t know what to ask for or how to interpret the results.  Dr’s don’t really offer hormone testing but there are things you can ask for and there are circumstances where it would be very useful to know eg if you were progesterone deficient,  symptoms of which are heavy periods, severe anxiety and insomnia.  <newline>  <newline> https://www.tiktok.com/@menopausedoctor/video/7204201997912886574 <newline>  <newline> (This won’t benefit you if your symptoms are caused by an overreaction to normal changes).;greenkittie;False;1;0.67;2023-04-03 07:43:35;/r/PMDD/comments/12ad3aj/hormone_level_testing/;pmdd

994;11zw3cz;A hope inducing month!! Read for details on what changes I’ve made.;This month my PMDD was so mild that dare I say it was what I’d imagine regular PMS would feel like! Usually my mood symptoms start day 17-18 like clockwork and everything just builds until I’m a pile of suicidal ideation, nausea, cramps, self loathing, self sabotaging, acid reflux, and soreness but this month I waited and waited and to my surprise it wasn’t until two days before I started that things became notably problematic.  <newline>  <newline> Those two days were rough I would say but considering all I’m going through I’d say they were remarkably mild. Last month I decided that would give myself a few more months and that if I couldn’t get things under control for myself I would start talking to my doctor about chemical menopause.  <newline>  <newline> Here are the changes that may have contributed to this month:  <newline>  <newline> 1. I started dancing every morning for at least five minutes. It’s my favorite thing to do, so for you this might be a completely different activity but the point was to get my body moving while stating positive affirmations for the day in my head. Things like who I am at my core (values, beliefs, etc.), what I want to embody that day, what I’m grateful for, etc. some days I was majestic and some I was just jumping around like a weirdo but every time I moved the way my body wanted to be moved and I think that’s what’s important. I really think this was perhaps the most important thing but who’s to say? <newline>  <newline> 2. I started taking magnesium glycinate a couple months ago. Turns out I had been taking magnesium calcinate which was the wrong kind all along. I’m glad I finally saw a gyno that clued me in on this because I had no idea.  <newline>  <newline> 3. I also started taking zinc pilonicate (sp?) a couple months ago at the recommendation of that same gyno.  <newline>  <newline> 4. I started taking nutritional yeast supplements about a month ago. This was something I implemented after watching a YouTube video where a nutritionist lays out what you might be deficient in if you have certain symptoms. A lot of things I related to were regarding a vitamin b deficiency and the video creator stated that nutritional yeast is packed with every b vitamin so I decided to give it a try.  <newline>  <newline> 5. I got back on my exercise routine. I’m pretty good about exercising at least 2-3 times a week but the last month I’ve been at more like 4-5 days a week.  <newline>  <newline> 6. I started being more mindful of my conversations with others and inner thoughts. No more bitching about my boyfriend or how overwhelmed I am or self pitying in general. Not to say the thoughts never popped up but I was mindful of them and shut them down once I recognized them. This also meant telling my girlfriends I was done with the husband trash talk. I just don’t need that negativity clouding my reality. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> I know that ideally I would’ve added one thing at a time and seen what really seemed to help as opposed to a bunch of things once and being left speculating what it really was. Please don’t comment stuff that is invalidating or hopeless because I’m feeling hopeful and I don’t need to be brought down.

995;11yy7qd;Why do people think women get moody on their period instead of before?;"How is that still such a common belief? It's called pre-menstrual for a reason. And yet it's always said that women only get moody for like four days of their period. When in reality it's up to two weeks 😂 I wished the female cycle would be more widely understood.  <newline>  <newline> Maybe because blood is visible and hormones are not. So women are ""allowed"" to feel moody when there's something that can be physically seen. This is such a lame excuse though. From a biological perspective this whole notion makes no sense. <newline>  <newline> What makes you moody is not cramps or blood. It's the hormones during luteal phase. And ain't nobody outside of here seems to get that 🗿 <newline>  <newline> I've come across TikTok videos with millions of views joking about women being moody on their period.

997;11xyrov;Anyone who gets so fast overwhelmed during PMDD and can't do much?;I am already a person right now who can't have much due to my mental health I guess? (PTSD). <newline> But during my period it's so much worse. <newline> Everything costs so much more energy, when I have an appointment it's to much very fast. Begin this year already after 15 min with the dentist. Being around people makes me very fast overwhelmed too. Same as doing chores, many times I can only do like 2 dishes, or is vacuuming to much, or writing something like this or answering people on whatsapp, or even being in a store, or having a few appointments in a week. <newline> I don't even know how I am going to survive trauma therapy when it starts in a few months during my hormons. <newline> When I travel to my bf which takes around 6 hours in train/bus I get overwhelmed so fast, almost get panick attacks, cry in public and it takes many days to feel a bit better. One time it even made my whole good free hormons period worser. I also already struggle with PTSD so it's not that I don't have this at all in my good period, but it's way better when I don't have hormons. <newline> I don't want to travel in mt good period either, because sometimes I only have 1 good weekend and I want him to be here with me. Because he still lives with his family and I don't feel comfortable being around much people. <newline>  <newline> I can't describe the feeling when I get overwhelmed. I wish I could. That would make me feel more understood, or feel like I understand myself better, or maybe I could explain it better to people. <newline> It's just this weird feeling that I have never been able to describe.;itsSylviaYvonne;False;6;1.0;2023-03-21 23:24:45;/r/PMDD/comments/11xyrov/anyone_who_gets_so_fast_overwhelmed_during_pmdd/;pmdd

Since the one blessing of this horrid disorder is that it follows a schedule, and a pretty standard set of symptoms for those of us aware/monitoring, I was thinking: what if we set up a support line of our own? This isn't to provide services a trained therapist should or anything like that. But it's kind of like, those of us who are in our clarity weeks could be available to the ladies who are in their rage week or slump weeks, either by phone/text or messenger, then we trade when they're in their clarity time and the rest of us are in rage week/slump week.  <newline>  <newline> I welcome any ideas from you on how to structure this stuff for privacy and emotional safety from all involved. But seeing as how all most of us need is active support when stuff is hard, and not need to have to explain why we feel the way we do... maybe it can make things that much more bearable.

1008;1172hfz;My PMDD mirrors bipolar....;Obviously minus the horrendous physical symptoms. <newline>  <newline> I was diagnosed with Bipolar a few years ago but it turns out it was ADHD and PMDD. <newline>  <newline> On the run up to my period, I feel something similar to mania. <newline>  <newline>  Not euphoric or psychotic mania though. It's like I have all this energy, like I've drank a ton of coffee. My mind RACES (even more so than usual), I get a ton of creative energy which usually results in me writing (literally) hundreds of Instagram stories documenting traumatic events in my life like a memoir 😭 (cue embarrassment and shame from oversharing to the extreme but in the moment, I can't stop myself). <newline>  <newline>  I suddenly want to exercise alot. I suddenly have the motivation to clean my house. My mind loops and loops on the same few themes....past relationships, past friendships, regrets, unhappiness in current life. I blurt things out without thinking. I am more prone to taking risks and spending impulsively. I am an emotional wreck swinging from happier than ever to depressed as hell. I stop showering and horrible insomnia creeps in. <newline>  <newline> Then when I start bleeding, after the first day I crash and feel absolutely depressed and hopeless for about a week. Feels like I've messed up my life irreparably and I'll never ever be happy. I hate my job more than ever and any little inconvenience sends me spiralling into tears or disassociation. <newline>  <newline> So you can imagine, before I recognised the cycle, I can see why this could look like bipolar!!;therouxrachelle;False;3;1.0;2023-02-20 09:29:25;/r/PMDD/comments/1172hfz/my_pmdd_mirrors_bipolar/;pmdd

1013;10pomq3;Coincidence or did I induce my period with my mind??;"I know this is PROBABLY a coincidence but... <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Earlier today you may have seen my post about ""day 28, no cramping, probably going to be late.""  And I was having an awful fucking time. The usual signs that I'm going to start, like feeling a wave of relief or mood lightening, a sudden urge to clean, boobs not hurting anymore, and period cramps, were all missing. So I figured I was going to be several days late. <newline>  <newline>    <newline> For the past hour I was searching this subreddit for ""induce period"". I read several posts about ways to possibly induce ones period, there were suggestions about parsley tea, raspberry leaf tea, etc. All things I don't have. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> I came across one comment though, that suggested to ""close your eyes, and imagine your brain sending signals to your uterus to start bleeding."" with a little more detail. <newline>  <newline> So I did that. I spent about two whole minutes imagining my brain sending signals to my uterus and imagining my uterus shedding its lining. <newline>  <newline> My pelvis felt a little warm after but I thought it was probably in my head. Still no period cramps. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> About 20 minutes later I got up to start the kettle for some tea. While it was warming up I went to go watch tiktok on the toilet and take a leisurely piss. <newline>  <newline> DID NOT expect to see red on the TP when I wiped.  BUT THERE SHE WAS!! <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Like I said at the beginning of this post, it's probably coincidence. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> BUT, IF YOUR PERIOD IS LATE, TRY IT!!

1018;10flfe2;Would you guys trust this person? And/Or continue treatment with them?;In a recent post I talked about how my obgyn recommended I see an acupuncturist. My mom found one in my area via a facebook group she's in, and I had a consult with him yesterday, and my first acupuncture session, and I've taken 2 doses of a tea he prescribed.  <newline>  <newline> As we all know, decision making can be mega complicated with PMDD, which is why I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on my experience, and the things that have made me a bit wary.  <newline>  <newline> Firstly, my mom and I were told (via his staff) that this acupuncturist has worked extensively with patients with PMDD, which I immediately found hard to believe. So in person my mom asked him about that and he estimated that out of the 1,800 people he's treated that he's treated 400-500 patients with PMDD. Honestly 400-500 people would be extensive, but do you guys even think that's possible? I'm literally the only person I know irl with PMDD, but maybe I'm being overly skeptical?  <newline>  <newline> Secondly, I hated the acupuncture experience itself, but I'm having a hard time differentiating between if this is just me getting in my own way/ my anxiety about trying something new, or I guess something legitimate?  I know ultimately I'm the only one who can make the decision to stop seeing him, but I'd still love to hear y'all's thoughts. I could feel myself trying to dissociate during the acupuncture, and (tw self harm) >!the needle part of the acupuncture session triggered old self harm urges, which were re-triggered again later that night in the shower. I think it's worth noting that I've never used needles to self harm, and that I've been self harm free for about 3 years now, maybe longer. !<  <newline>  <newline> Why might I continue? The acupuncturist said I should see a 50% reduction in my symptoms 2 weeks into seeing him. Which if true, would be amazing. I know a lot of us here would give up a lot for a 50% reduction.  I'm trying really hard to be open minded, plus my mom said she felt really good about the whole thing, so I'm trying to factor that in as well, because I lean a lot on her judgement when mine is PMDD compromised.;HalloweenGorl;False;12;1.0;2023-01-18 23:09:39;/r/PMDD/comments/10flfe2/would_you_guys_trust_this_person_andor_continue/;pmdd

1020;10cn5dk;PMDD the week before uni exams;I'm studying Electronic engineering at uni (in my second year) and I struggle with the assessments at the best of times anyway. I'm generally quite good at revising in advance and feeling prepared, and when I sit down to revise I can usually stay focused.  <newline>  <newline> But this time I've had 2 weeks to prepare and have done probably 10 hours of work total for them even though I've sat down to study so many times. Every study session I do feels like I have about 30 minutes of studying before I have to take a break or I get distracted and have to claw my attention back to my studying.  I beat myself up about it for a while because I thought I was just being lazy and needed to just get my head down and do it. <newline>  <newline> Until I remembered that I had a similar issue the week before my last period where I just couldn't get out of bed and I just felt depressed and didn't know what to do about it except push through. <newline>  <newline> I'm on my 5th month of roaccutane as well and with it I'm meant to take a contraceptive pill every day. I did over summer because I was camping and didn't want my period but I'm asexual so, while I know I'm meant to take it, I don't anymore. I never wanted to be on hormonal contraceptives to begin with because I was scared of something like this happening. And now it's a reality and is impacting my uni work I don't know what to do.  <newline>  <newline> Firstly, what am I meant to do about my exams? Have all 3 this week and I feel totally unprepared. Feel like I'm going to have to go to the student welfare thing because I literally have no other options. <newline>  <newline> Second, what's the best way to get a PMDD diagnosis under the NHS?

I've found it extremely isolating, in all elements of my life: work, academic, social, and romantic realms. I would love to talk to other people like me. I've been reading everyone's posts on the PMDD sub for a year or so now, and it seems like I'm not the only one who is having a really tough time with everything from the relationship volatility to the insomnia. While posting one-off in a forum can be a good release, I think being able to speak to others real-time may have more impact in buffering against that feeling of suffering alone. <newline>  <newline> I wanted to create a zoom support group where maybe, once a week or every two weeks we can all hop on a call and share our experiences in a judgement-free, emotionally supportive environment. Reading everyone's experiences has helped normalize the condition: I would want the group to have a similar theme. <newline>  <newline> Before we begin, I'd want to have a preliminary call to set some guidelines together and maybe a bit of a routine. I'm really passionate about art so if we eventually got to a place where we could do art therapy exercises together that might be cathartic? <newline>  <newline> A bit about me: I'm a 24 year old psychology graduate (BA) pursuing a MA in child & adolescent psychology. I'm very passionate about trauma-informed care. In my free time, I practice advaita vedanta, paint/draw, hike, knit, do yoga, cook/bake, play chess, read, and watch anime. <newline>  <newline> ***If this interests you, please message me and I will put you on a list so that when I set up the zoom group & discord you'll be on it!*** <newline>  <newline> PS:  Just to be clear, I am not a licensed clinician (yet).

1025;zxxowb;The perfect storm of luteal hell (TW suicidal thoughts and self harm);TW: Suicidal thoughts, self harm <newline>  <newline> Oh boy y’all, I fucked up GOOD this luteal phase, and I’m posting here because you’re the only ones that will understand. Just before my luteal phase my antidepressants were increased, I stopped taking adderall, and decided to quit marijuana. Around this same time, some stuff triggered some major PTSD and brought up some flashbacks that kind of upended my world.  <newline>  <newline> Guys, I basically told my entire family to go fuck themselves, and wrote my mother paragraphs and paragraphs of awful stuff accusing her of contributing to certain traumas in my life. None of those things were untrue, but they were said in anger, and in hurtful ways.  <newline>  <newline> Then I posted some teenage level emo crap on Snapchat, which worried the hell out of some friends, and pissed my sister off to no end, causing another fight.  <newline>  <newline> It felt like a bomb was going to go off in my head, and if I didn’t say something I was going to explode. I usually get a bad migraine the day before my period, but this lasted the entire two weeks of my luteal phase, and it was different than my “normal” migraines. It’s like I could feel all the neurons in my brain firing at once, horrible tinnitus, my ears kept popping, and I had what felt like bees buzzing in my brain. I could feel my rage building and building, sometimes just laying there thinking of nothing, I could still feel the rage bubbling. I wanted to scream. I wanted to punch the wall. I wanted to physically harm myself in ways that haven’t crossed my mind since I was a teenager.  <newline>  <newline> I started having intense panic attacks, which I haven’t suffered from in many years. Shaking, heart palpitations, sweating, air hunger etc. But they wouldn’t stop, and lasted for days. <newline>  <newline> I convinced myself I was dying, that I *wanted* to die, and that I was for sure going to be dead by Christmas, one way or another. I isolated myself from everyone who loves me, and haven’t responded to most texts since Christmas Day when I spammed facebook with emo posts about not having family that cared about me, not trusting anyone because of my childhood, etc etc.   <newline>  <newline> I started re-taking gabapentin and I swear to god it was like instant relief in some ways. My brain calmed down considerably, and while I was still a sad emo little goth, the rage quieted a little. Then the pre-period battery drain happened and I slept for nearly two days straight. <newline>  <newline> My period came today, and I woke up feeling amazing. Happy. I can’t even fathom being the angry, scared, hurtful person I was **TWO DAYS AGO**.  I truly feel like Jekyll and Hyde. And now I have to find a way to rebuild a series of relationships I have possibly altered forever. <newline>  <newline> Has anyone been through this?

1032;zb0yod;A possible answer;My doctor and I have been working together for almost a year to figure out what's wrong, mostly focused on rheumatology as my major issue is joint pain (or at least I thought, depression, bad period, the likes were in my brain completely separate) answers which all were coming up negative. Then I'm scrolling through Twitter of all places and see an article about ADHD, Autism and PMDD and I fit every single box on this diagnosis. I was pretty sure my doctor was going to dismiss me if I brought it up but within hours she had responded with a referral to gynecology (even if this isn't the exact diagnosis, it could have very well pointed me in the right direction). While we're not sure what's going on this is seeming like a possibility.  <newline>  <newline> Is anyone willing to talk a little more about how joint pain plays into symptoms. I saw this was one of them but there isn't much expanded on.  <newline>  <newline> I'm also wondering if anyone who's transgender who has this condition has any advice on keeping track of symptoms and cycles without the gender dysphoria 😭 plz. I'm already dealing with increased depression in general and now on top of this I actually do need to record my cycles and it's just so taxing.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway I hope to find more medical information soon but was looking for personal experiences to sort of guage.;AsterTheDisaster1;False;0;1.0;2022-12-02 23:05:45;/r/PMDD/comments/zb0yod/a_possible_answer/;pmdd

1034;ywp4j8;Finally think I’ve fixed my week 3 PMDD;Guys I’m in my week 3 and I’m totally calm, confident and laughing, dancing a little.

1035;ywe6tk;pmdd portrait project - pmdd awareness;Hi everyone. Some of you may remember a while ago I asked if anyone would like to take part in a portrait based awareness project for pmdd. It took amlittle while to get organised but I've finally published the Web page and the first portrait is now on instagram and will be released on reddit today. I've started with my own portrait because I thought that was only fair given the nature of the material. It's not pretty but it is pmdd. I've included the links in the comments section if anyone would like to take a look or share. All the portraits are up on the Web page, I'm just releasing them one at a time on social media to increase exposure. I don't have a lot of followers so it'll only be seen by a few people but I'm hoping it'll make a small difference. Thanks so much to those of you who took part and if anyone would like to add their image, please contact me. I'd love to include some more portraits and stories.;drawn_from_life;False;3;1.0;2022-11-16 00:15:03;/r/PMDD/comments/ywe6tk/pmdd_portrait_project_pmdd_awareness/;pmdd
1036;yvjjed;I miss who I was two weeks ago;"I have suspected I have PMDD for a year or so now, though in hindsight I think I've had it...well, forever. But I didn't mention or really believe it until all the other factors I could blame symptoms on were gone: Grad school ended in 2018, and I left my stressful job and living situation over a year ago. My diet is better than it ever has been (I used to struggle with binge eating) and I walk about 2 miles a day, 6 days a week. The only explanation left for the spiral is biology. <newline>  <newline> I got a referral from my PCP/GP to see an OBGYN, but the appointment isn't until December 21st. That is a bit of a bummer, but I was a bit glad because: <newline>  <newline> 1. I made the appointment during the follicular phase so I could actually see a silver lining, lol <newline> 2. it has given me an opportunity to journal a little bit each day about how I feel, my physical symptoms, etc. <newline>  <newline> I use Flo, but that doesn't really allow for much detail. I've been journaling (just a paragraph/few sentances a day) since I made the appointment, Day 8 of my cycle. <newline>  <newline> For the first two weeks (until day 14 exactly) I was writing things like: <newline>  <newline> 1. ""I feel energetic. I feel hopeful, happy, in control."" <newline> 2. ""self-efficacy, self-esteem is high."" <newline> 3. ""I notice it was easier to make better food choices."" <newline> 4. ""I stayed up too late but I still feel great."" <newline>  <newline> Day 14: <newline>  <newline> 1. ""Today I feel okay. I slept so much. My mood is a little more sad."" <newline>  <newline> Days 17-20: <newline>  <newline> 1. ""I spent the evening studying but had bouts of sadness and teariness."" <newline> 2. ""I felt more down and irritable."" <newline> 3. ""Much less physical energy."" <newline> 4. ""More negative, fearful thoughts. Negative self-talk too."" <newline>  <newline> Days 26-30 <newline>  <newline> 1. ""Today has been emotional. I really want to cry. I have been having a lot of negative thoughts about myself today."" <newline> 2. ""Another sad day. It's really had to think anything good about myself."" <newline> 3. ""I feel a lot of shame today. I am trying not to cry on the way to work event. I have felt fat all day."" <newline> 4. ""My energy and interest feel almost non-existent. I've been crying on and off all day. I'm just wishing to start bleeding so I feel better."" <newline> 5. ""I've been watching YouTube videos and cleaning a bit, but none of those distractions are really helping. What I really want is someone who loves me to touch and cuddle me."" <newline>  <newline> Today I have felt considerably better. I think the emotional process/ing of letting myself cry all day yesterday helped. My cycle should start over tonight or tomorrow. I can't wait.

1038;ysrlny;feeling very lonely (just a rant);My last period was short so I knew this time around I was going to suffer. Started feeling it a week into November. And now here I am. <newline>  <newline>  I'm just ranting because there's nothing I can do about it. I suppose I feel like I'm not being appreciated lately so on top of it all that's the fixation this month it seems.... I used to hang out with friends so much and see people and go out over the weekends. Ever since covid and everything being expensive I can't go out cuz I'm broke, my friends are always busy cuz life (and I don't blame them) and my S/O is far away. <newline>  <newline>  Usually when I feel alone I go out and have a date by myself and you know make myself feel better but yeah. I don't wanna talk to my s/0 bc I don't want them to think it's their fault, although I do feel...lonely but what else can we do, we already talk on the phone 24/7. But today I'm particularly bitter and I rather be crying alone in my room than on the phone saying nothing. And I don't wanna pick a fight for no reason when they don't deserve it.  <newline>  <newline> The Usual things that keep me busy  I can't do or have tried already but my attention span sucks right now and I'm in too much pain to workout. So, scrolling through Instagram I was and it just makes me think of all the shit I haven't gotten to do yet and if I look in the mirror I feel like a disgusting pimply pig. I just wanna jump off a fucking building but I know I'll feel better tomorrow or who knows maybe after I take a nap.  <newline>  <newline> I hate this feeling so much bc I know people wanna help me but they don't understand the self sabotage and I don't wanna be behind people begging for attention because that makes me feel even worse and ashamed. I'm usually fine being alone but it's just particularly hard this cycle. I just want everything to stop or can I just not exist for an hour or two, I'm so tired, I just need a hug.  <newline>  <newline> To anyone else feeling like shit, wish I could give you a hug too.;thatonegothunicorn;False;1;1.0;2022-11-12 00:16:27;/r/PMDD/comments/ysrlny/feeling_very_lonely_just_a_rant/;pmdd
1039;yqteyo;PMDD and the holiday season; <newline> Anyone else notice that come the holiday season their PMDD is so much worse? Especially on the depression side of things? I know for some the holiday season is a joyous time but it really sucks for me. My mom died when I was 11, my dad left shortly after and I haven’t talked to him since I was probably 14, my grandparents adopted me and about 4 years ago they both passed. Since then none of my family will talk to me, they do holiday gatherings at the family homestead and don’t invite me or my sister. So it’s just my sister and I. She includes me in as much as she can with her husbands family as I am close to them, but it’s not the same. My husband didn’t come from a big family and his dad passed 10 years ago so holidays are just us and his mom, and I love my MIL dearly, but it’s just not the same. We don’t have kids yet ( TTC a few years now ). My best friends are like family to me so they do invite us to their dinners but again, it’s not the same. I just feel so cold and lonely this time of year and when my PMDD rounds the corner I just feel like I’m better off not here anymore. I miss my family so much. Sometimes I don’t know how to combat these feelings. Looking at old photos and videos just makes me more sad- seeing the huge happy family we once were. Also I have tried reaching out to the remaining family we have ( which I was once extremely close with, lived with etc ) and they tell me they’ll be in touch/invite us to their dinners, and they just don’t. So I live through Facebook photos and posts. I feel so pathetic.;Wearetheweirdos704;False;1;0.9;2022-11-09 19:47:01;/r/PMDD/comments/yqteyo/pmdd_and_the_holiday_season/;pmdd
1040;yqmdgs;PMDD or PME? Does it matter?;I forgot to put a Trigger warning, TW: Suicide <newline>  <newline> I had a bad breakup a year ago and gradually the pain from this breakup kind of turned into regular depression. I started to notice that I got really really depressed the week before my period. I also found that, even when I had been improving, all the anger and sadness about the breakup would come straight back. Really negative thoughts. <newline>  <newline> I then found out about PMDD from a tiktok which said 'you know its not normal to feel suicidal the week before your period'. I do not feel suicidal but the week before my period I do have this feeling of 'this is all too hard, too hard to keep going, I am never going to be happy again' <newline>  <newline> I found this community and I just related so hard to all the memes and posts that were here, like it gets really difficult for that week, and no one seems to understand, and people say 'everyone gets emotional around their period, and at least you know what it is'. But it is just really hard to go through. <newline>  <newline> I am now desperate for treatment and I am thinking of going on sertraline. I tried the mini pill and it made me cry more and more anxiety. I tried so many vitamins. I am in therepy for a year now and I do a bit of exercise most days. My doctor just keeps recommending anti-depressants. <newline>  <newline> I don't really know why I am posting this, it is just the week before my period and I am feeling so sad. I know no one can diagnose me or tell me what will fix this, but it just feels nice to know I am not alone, and I am not crazy. <newline>  <newline> I also read today on this sub about PME, which I am thinking I could maybe have? I am not sure, because I have always struggled with depression on and off for years now, but the PMS was never this bad before, and I read that PMDD starts on average at age 26, which is when this started. I had a really bad breakdown two weeks ago on day two of my period which made me think this might not be PMDD? But I also have a week and a bit in the middle of my cycle where I feel normal and not as bad which made me think it is? A diagnoses does not even matter to me at this point, I just want to feel better.;describetheinternet;False;3;1.0;2022-11-09 15:38:22;/r/PMDD/comments/yqmdgs/pmdd_or_pme_does_it_matter/;pmdd

1042;ymf3qu;I think I have PMDD…idk what to do;so recently I’ve come to the conclusion that I have PMDD. I’ve noticed it within the past couple years that around 2 weeks before my period, I start to feel very different. I thought it was normal PMS, but after learning about PMDD on tiktok and doing some research I’ve found that my symptoms are in fact not normal. Physically, I usually have sore breasts, headaches, back pain, increased appetite and cravings, increased fatigue, nausea, cramps, and digestive issues.  <newline>  <newline> Mentally, however, it’s so much worse. Increased anxiety/panic attacks, depression, lack of motivation, s*icidal/instrusive/ruminating thoughts, feeling helpless, worthless, irritability, crying a lot, lashing out in anger, increase in rejection sensitivity. It’s awful.  <newline>  <newline> The main reason I believe it’s PMDD is as soon as my period starts, all is well. I feel fine. I still have minor physical symptoms like cramps, back pain, and headaches. But the mental symptoms are practically gone. It is comforting to have a reason behind my behavior, but it sucks because there isn’t much help online on how to treat it.  <newline>  <newline> I am on the birth control pill, and I have been for almost 5 years. I’ve heard that it can either help or make PMDD worse. I’m not on any SSRIs or other mental health medication, because I had a bad experience with fluoxetine. So I was wondering how other people handle their PMDD. do you take medication? or natural supplements?? Therapy??;mxddy15;False;1;0.86;2022-11-05 00:24:39;/r/PMDD/comments/ymf3qu/i_think_i_have_pmddidk_what_to_do/;pmdd

I don’t want to be a burden on him but feel like one when I’m troubled by these symptoms. Yesterday, I looked up an ex on Instagram. Out of the blue. He’s married and writes long captions about how wonderful his wife is. He was extremely toxic to me. I can’t tell if he’s overcompensating on social media or is in love for real. My therapist and I worked for months on me when I was dealing with that breakup. I feel bad that he treats someone else so much better than he treated me (atleast on Instagram), I know I have a life of my own now but it pinched. It hurts.  <newline>  <newline> I want to be a better person but I don’t know how. I feel messed up on some days. On other days, I’m okay, keep my nose clean, do what I can.

1059;xpu474;PMDD and Pregnancy!;"[PREGANTÉ!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShUeudtaFg) dopamine video for your brains <newline>  <newline> So this is my fifth pregnancy, hopefully will be child #3, and my first pregnancy since finding out PROGESTERONE IS MY ENEMY (got diagnosed after baby #1).  It's comical how cheerful my spouse is about this because ""I won't have to worry about your PMDD mood swings anymore!  You'll just be normal pregnant crazy!""  He was so happily baffled with the first baby that I told me he wish he'd knocked me up years ago.  He had been worried it would be worse. <newline>  <newline> It's very odd, since me+progesterone=pain <newline>  <newline> Progesterone spikes during your leutal phase, because it's essential for maintaining a pregnancy.  During pregnancy [it just keeps going up](http://www.repro-med.net/wp-content/uploads/Progesterone.png) FOREVER.  So this makes a lot of sense why PMDD sufferers have such a varied response to pregnancy.  Some cannot survive, some do not have enough progesterone to maintain the pregnancy, and for some it completely eliminates their PMDD.  It's kinda nice to always know when I'm ovulating for conception attempts but that's about the only plus. <newline>  <newline> But I tried the naxplanon implant.  It's progesterone.  It made me worse (although only low-key worse because it's less spikes and a lower dose than say the oral pill).  I had it out after a couple of months when we decided to try for #3. <newline>  <newline> Just last week I got really upset about something.  And then I ate food.  And then I felt fine.  I was literally just hangry.  The realization that it wasn't my cycle (which I was expecting) both clued me in that I might be pregnant and make me a little curious about why I react this way to pregnancy. <newline>  <newline> Pregnancy also is such a cocktail of hormones and neurochemicals that without a LOT more research there's no way to explain WHY PMDD sufferers have this impossibly wide range of responses to pregnancy or even why any given situation happens. <newline>  <newline> Imagine if they looked into that.  What if supplementing with one of those hormones or chemicals could alleviate your symptoms and turn you into just the slightly emotional level of a pregnant lady instead of the demon lycanthrope we have to deal with normally?  One commonality with us seems to be the impact progesterone has on us - so what if whatever it is about pregnancy that helps could balance the difference for those of us who, like me, respond badly to more progesterone?";Cannie_Flippington;False;11;1.0;2022-09-27 22:01:27;/r/PMDD/comments/xpu474/pmdd_and_pregnancy/;pmdd

1061;xhi0pp;DBT + loving kindness meditation!;I’m not really sure if I have PMDD, BPD or both but to the person who suggested Dialectical Behavior Therapy a few months ago as a reply to one of my posts - thank you so much!!!! I need to make sure everyone knows about it.  <newline> It’s not the perfect fix and it takes practice, but it has helped me so much!  The best part about it is there is free material all over the internet. I am working with a therapist to help keep me accountable and the growth I have made makes me feel more in control of my life mentally and emotionally.  <newline>  <newline> I felt stuck in a loop. 1 week okay but period, 1 week feeling on top of the world not having to put in any additional effort, 2 weeks feeling anxious and irritable AF and feeling like my life is spiralling out of control and like I can’t accomplish anything and repeat repeat repeat.  <newline> I tried SSRIs but they made me depressed during the luteal phase and I’d rather feel and manage my emotions than feel depressed. <newline>  <newline> DBT has helped me find healthy coping skills because all I had were unhealthy ones before. I’ve found a good mix of vitamins, meditation, exercise, boundaries, breathing, healthy distraction, practicing DBT/therapy to feel like I’m gaining control again - but the kicker is making sure I do all of that in the times that it is the hardest and doesn’t come naturally or easily. I put a monthly calendar up and marked all over it. Stars getting bigger leading up to ovulation and a note that says put all of the effort in now! It’s not easy but go for that walk, book that massage, take those vitamins, nourish yourself, take a bath, breathe and push yourself to do the things you love and SET BOUNDARIES.  <newline>  <newline> Be kind to yourselves and keep going!  <newline>  <newline> I encourage everyone to also check out this meditation that was suggested to me. You can search for it on YouTube  <newline>  <newline> “Loving kindness meditation to develop mindfulness and compassion” by WiseMindBody <newline>  <newline> Peace and love!

1062;xb77y7;toying with the idea to make PMDD text buddies;Edit: I've created a group on telegram. While anyone is *more* than welcome to join, the original purpose of the group is to be a network for those that struggle with suicidal desires/thoughts/emotions related to PMDD  <newline>  <newline> 💙💙💙💙💙 <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Hi there I just got over a horrific episode of my symptoms that lasted 7 days. <newline>  <newline>  This was the closest I have ever come to really wanting to go through with suicide. Now that I am on the other end I am grateful I kept telling myself that it would pass. However I am wondering if anyone has ever thought of exchanging numbers with other women on here and making and making a WhatsApp or telegram group. I was considering how helpful it might be for real time help from someone that actually understands what is happening. <newline>  <newline> This weekend I called the Canadian suicide helpline. I was calmly in a panic trying not to hurt myself. She asked if I was in immediate danger right now and I said no I'm talking to you I'm focused on talking to you and  trying to stay safe for my children. She said it helps to find a distraction and that was the end of the conversation. In that moment I realized she had no idea What I was going through And there was nothing she could say to me that would specifically help. <newline>  <newline> Then I got thinking...what about a few strangers in a group chat rhat can help each other out? Noi pressure. No long drawn out chats required. No responsibilities (let's be real, we can't save others when we are under water ourselves) but the purpose of the group is that very short: talk each other off the ledge. <newline>  <newline> Just a thought.  <newline> I expect zero replies. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> -------------- <newline> Edit: I'm so happy you are interested! <newline> I'd like to use telegram since you don't have to share your phone number with the group. You can go to your settings and hide your number. I think if everyone creates a telegram account, and sends me their username, I should be able to create a group. I've never done this before but it should work according to what I read online. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Hey, I'm using Telegram to chat. Join me!

1063;x8h4vc;dysphoria/autism and birth control PMDD venting;Hi, first time posting to this reddit. or posting on reddit at all, actually.  <newline> I went off birth control around 6 months ago because i found that it was making my pmdd worse. i haven’t had a regular period or cycle since then, which has been great for reducing the occurrence of my pmdd issues but horrible for predicting when they’ll strike next. this past week, i knew it was coming, but i was still shocked when i woke up this morning and was bleeding heavily. today has been horrible. i’ve been hungry, spacey, horribly sad and dysphoric. I have so much that i need to get done for school and i feel so incapable. i’m thinking about taking an adderall just to get something done but i’ve read that pmdd can reduce the effectiveness of stimulants. i tried taking 20mg of pepcid (ghosted1996 on instagram has lots of info about this! thank you haley!) but i’m worried i’m still gonna be all foggy. anyone else have experience with going off of birth control and experiencing horrible hormone imbalance? i feel so alone and defeated by my body. i just want to sleep until it’s over.  <newline>  <newline> on top of all of this, i have to get dinner with my family later this week and they don’t take my health issues seriously because they think i’m not autistic and they don’t know that i’m trans. i’m worried i’m gonna have some kind of public meltdown if our meal conversation goes poorly. pmdd also worsens my gender dysphoria. i wish it was easier but i just don’t know what else i can do. i guess i don’t really have a point here. i just needed to spill. if anyone reads this, thank you.;jessieg44;False;1;1.0;2022-09-07 21:30:40;/r/PMDD/comments/x8h4vc/dysphoriaautism_and_birth_control_pmdd_venting/;pmdd

1067;wpnu2z;Can anybody else relate to my exact symptoms? (BONUS: also sharing a few things that actually help me);So for a whole 10 days before my period, I start to feel very low on energy. Like physically drained. As if I’ve just run a marathon a day before?? My breasts also get kinda sore. It’s manageable for sure but it does hurt when I take my bra off at the end of the day. This symptom is worse some months than others.  <newline>  <newline> I also begin to feel emotionally low. Let’s say it’s a Saturday and I’d made a plan to go out for coffee with a close friend. Because I’m now feeling low / emotionally dull and gloomy - I’ll honestly be a lot more inclined to cancel the plan. Who wants to get things done or be social when you feel low and gloomy? It’s like during these 10 days - I have a lot less love and excitement to give. It also gets difficult for me for visualize myself happy in the future. <newline>  <newline> BUT if I do put in tons of mental energy and truly force myself to NOT cancel on the plan, then once I do meet my friend - I’m able to actually have a good time. But getting myself to do that is super difficult.  <newline>  <newline> So I’ve noticed for me, PMDD just makes me more INCLINED to cancel plans and not get things done cause I’m feeling low and gloomy (which makes me want to isolate and take a step back from everything). But once I do get some things done or once I force myself to step outside, it’s not like I’m incapable of feeling joy / productive. It’s just that it’s much harder to put myself in a situation where I am able to be productive. At least that’s what I’ve noticed.  <newline>  <newline> Everything seems to take a lot more mental energy and self talk, and life doesn’t feel too colourful / happy. My anxiety is also heightened, and I cry a lot more easily during these days. It’s like I’m a lot more emotionally fragile and sensitive.  <newline>  <newline> What does help me is having exercise (even just a 20min home workout) and some basic social plans as a non negotiable with myself. Ticking a few things off my to do list everyday, working out, going for a walk, and meeting friends over the weekend - while is super difficult during PMDD - actually really really helps. Also having a busy schedule somehow distracts from the gloomy thoughts. My therapist mentioned that I can’t wait to NOT feel gloomy in order to do things which are supposed to be healthy and helpful for our mind. I need to do these things even when I’m feeling low and don’t want to do them.  <newline>  <newline> My therapist also recommends having some go-to self soothing + distracting activities which I do on a daily basis on my PMDD days. These can be different for everyone. Can include some comedy shows or movies, a hot shower, peppy music, funny YouTube videos, scented candles, looking at old pics and videos from happy times, mindfully enjoying my favourite meal, getting a massage done etc. She mentioned keeping a diary where I list down all the 10-30 activities I can think of. So that it’s easy to do these. She mentioned that these activities won’t magically take away the emotional low but it’ll for sure prevent it from getting worse (and in some cases may even help feel better).  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, PMDD sucks and it’s a whole struggle but I’m now finding out that tons of my friends have it and it’s a lot more common than I thought. Most people don’t even know it’s a thing so you don’t find them openly discussing it. And while PMDD is definitely a struggle, there are things you can do help and support yourself through it ❤️;warm-summer-rains;False;7;1.0;2022-08-16 07:27:45;/r/PMDD/comments/wpnu2z/can_anybody_else_relate_to_my_exact_symptoms/;pmdd

None of this is medical advice just hoping my journey might help someone else.  <newline>  <newline> I have had PMDD for longer than I think I know, just didn't know it was a thing. After having my son, I thought I had post partum depression. I felt ashamed to ask for help because I'm supposed to be happy yeah? I then lost my dad to COVID and went even further into depression. I went on meds. Started to help through my actual depression but once that ""cleared up"" my hell week was even worse than before.  <newline>  <newline> Doc upped my meds. Went to the gyno who basically said I'm hormone sensitive and that I could go on birth control. I told him I was tired of meds and would like them tested in which he said he doesn't do that.  <newline>  <newline> At that point my husband found a TikTok of a woman who had hormone therapy. Her symptoms all the same as mine. After ovulation, moody, rage, fatigue, skin crawling, no sex drive, feeling like I'm stuck in fight or flight and can't get out. So I made an appointment. My initial appointment they schedule blood work to test during ovulation to check my levels and gave me progesterone lotion to help as she was sure that was the issue. Apparently it's very common for women after kiddos and post 30.  <newline>  <newline> Two days later after I started the cream. My mood stabilized, I could handle my emotions, no skin crawly feeling, I felt like myself.

1070;wlb7q3;Could this be PMDD or just my hormones being out of whack?;Hello! I’ve been struggling when it comes to my mental health lately for the past 2 months and I just found out about PMDD through Twitter and I’m wondering if that’s something I might be experiencing. About 2 weeks ago, I was sleeping over my boyfriend’s house and it was wonderful. I was really happy but about a week before going back home, I started feeling really sad and just irritated. Finally came home and I haven’t really stopped crying since. I’ve been feeling really emotional being away from my boyfriend which I find weird because I haven’t always been this clingy. Then I caught Covid from a family member and started getting horrible body aches in my legs and my back. I thought it was Covid but about 2 days later, my period came and the cramps hurt really bad and they never have hurt that much. Whenever I’m on my period, I’m not that much of a bleeder and usually on my 2nd day, it’s rarely ever heavy. But during this cycle, I literally had blood dripping down my leg on the 2nd day. I’ve been feeling very sad lately like nothing in life brings me excitement. I don’t feel productive I feel weak. I’ve been feeling depressed and more anxious. And I’ve been having suicidal thoughts which concerns me because I’ve always loved my life I don’t know why I’m feeling this way it’s just scary. I’ve also been struggling with my identity, a lot of the time I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t recognize myself anymore like I used to. My apologies if this whole thing is a mess I just wanted to know from people who have this condition, if this sounds like something I might have.;Interesting_Bed2348;False;2;1.0;2022-08-10 22:46:49;/r/PMDD/comments/wlb7q3/could_this_be_pmdd_or_just_my_hormones_being_out/;pmdd

On top of this, unless you’re blood-related or married into the family, you’re not allowed to go on this vacation, hence why I’m not there with him.  <newline>  <newline> Last year was my first year of experiencing the week of no contact, but he still managed to find a way to contact me every few days when he could connect to wifi in a family member’s car. On top of this, I was on my own vacation with an old friend at the same time, so I was decently distracted and time passed much faster while I waited for him to come home.  <newline>  <newline> However, this year is vastly different. We live together, for one thing, and our relationship is much more intimate, close, and connected than it was last year. More as of late, I also recently had to kick my own best friend out of our house due to some terrible circumstances, so I’m still reeling from that. On top of this, I found out that my dad has a mass on his pancreas that may be cancerous, and another relative died last week, which I had to find out from Facebook because nobody contacted me. It’s been a rough two weeks.  <newline>  <newline> My boyfriend knew about all of this and tried to be supportive while he was with me, but he had to leave for his trip last Saturday. Ever since, I’ve been nothing but an absolute ball of anger, anxiety, sadness, and depression, all due to the recent stressors AND the beginning of my hell week. He isn’t contacting me the same way he did last year, and whenever he does, I get angry because he’s having so much fun, and basically just saying “sorry you’re not doing well”. It’s really putting me in a bad place and I don’t know how I’m going to keep doing this in the future. It feels like the pain of a breakup.;brooker_dewitt;False;0;1.0;2022-08-03 01:35:12;/r/PMDD/comments/wetbg6/my_boyfriend_is_gone_for_a_week_with_no_way_to/;pmdd
1075;wdfmt6;PMDD portraits, update;Hello to all who have expressed an interest in taking part in my PMDD portraits idea. I just wanted to provide an update, especially to those who have already sent through their photos.  <newline> I've just had an abdominal hysterectomy ,(although they left my ovaries in there so no help for PMDD) so I'll likely be working much slower than  usual for a few weeks. Apologies for the delay but I'm hoping to get a completed self portrait up soon for you to check out to see the kind if thing I'm doing. <newline> If you wanted to have a look at some of my commissions to get an idea.of what I do you can take.a look at my instagram @kathryn.carter_portraits <newline>  <newline> I'm hoping to take a more artistic approach with our portraits but it gives you an introduction to my work and may even help you make a suggestion or request for your portrait.

1076;wd5md0;Pad and tampon recommendations?;First time posting a question, but I’m trying to find new cotton pads/tampons. I used to use L. Organic Cotton pads and tampons but saw a [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRDwMCDL/?k=1) how they could be related to an ingredient that causes reproductive harm with the ingredient titanium dioxide. I originally started using L because it offered me so much pain relief after using Kotex. This is only my personal experience and I’ve been using L so long that maybe some of it is also just my hormones leveling out after puberty. However I don’t want to risk going back to a brand with harmful ingredients or tons of synthetics. Any truly 100% natural pads or tampons? What are y’all using on your periods? I’m open to most options, I know that polyethylene (a common plastic used for absorbency) is a very common ingredient as well, I won’t completely dismiss options that use this but would be interested in hearing if there are options that don’t. Thank you so much for your time ❤️ <newline>  <newline> Update 8/1: Hi y’all! So excited to read through all the responses! I do have a menstrual cup but have mixed feelings about it (it’s the Fun cup I got when I worked at an adult shop) so I’m interested in other options. Right now I have COVID and had to get stuff through postmates so my options were limited, however If y’all are interested I picked out “Organyc” Organic cotton pads for sensitive skin and CVS brand Live Better Organic cotton pads. Both use corn starch instead of polyethylene. However the first is a little pricy and they both only come with 10. First was about $7 and second was about $5. Excited to explore all my options for something safe and cost effective though. Thanks everyone!;pixiepussie333;False;25;1.0;2022-08-01 02:14:43;/r/PMDD/comments/wd5md0/pad_and_tampon_recommendations/;pmdd
1077;w6aqah;Today is for anger: The general population is stupid;I hate when people are lazy as fuck. Yes, I’m lazy but not about things that are important for me to grow!

1080;w00txh;An antidote to the luteal phase shopping binges;I'm someone who gets consumeristic and spends needlessly before my period, and I know several other people on here have expressed a similar issue.  <newline>  <newline> I've found that when I want to buy something, what I'm really craving is a. a hit of feel good chemicals and b.  visual stimulation. I want to see something pretty.  <newline>  <newline> Another way to get those two things? By creating! Humans are designed to create, but capitalism has done a really good job of transmuting our desire to create into a desire to consume.  <newline>  <newline> We're constantly pummeled with messages that we're not good enough, which makes us think that we can't create good art and that we need to buy something to improve ourselves instead.  <newline>  <newline> That's bullshit.  <newline>  <newline> So I've been really intentional the last few cycles about getting creative any time I have the impulse to shop. I've found free drawing lessons on YouTube and I also have a journal with some cheap paints, construction paper, etc. that I use for art journaling.  <newline>  <newline> I am by no means an artist, so I literally search up the blogs and YouTube channels of K-12 art teachers for approachable projects and inspiration.  <newline>  <newline> Makes all the difference, and you end up feeling fulfilled instead of more empty and mad at yourself;Top_Yam5054;False;3;1.0;2022-07-15 22:20:59;/r/PMDD/comments/w00txh/an_antidote_to_the_luteal_phase_shopping_binges/;pmdd

1083;vl3miz;my personal tips and tricks;"So I've read that pmdd symptoms result from the changes within the change of phase themselves. If you notice, you have the worst days of certain symptoms for 2-3 before they subside and move onto something else. <newline>  <newline> It's helped me to make a schedule where I highlight roughly the days where my body transitions from one phase to another, and then of course I highlight the 5-10 day danger zone before I expect my period. <newline>  <newline> My period is hella annoying tho because it's not a 28 day cycle. It's more like a 35-38 day cycle so it's not always perfect.. but anyway, I do this and take a picture of it and send it to my fiance... So he can be more ready for my days filled with fatigue, apathy, crying spells, irritability, cystic acne, insomnia, binge eating, etc <newline>  <newline> I also wanted to share that emotional pain is recognized in your body the same as physical pain. If you are ever stuck in a state of despair or are in a cry spell, take 2-3 Advil. It will remove that broken heart feeling. <newline>  <newline> If your boobs hurt, your best friend is a good sports bra. Keep those babies close to your body, trust me.  <newline>  <newline> Pmdd gets worse with age. So make sure you adjust your medication if you feel like it's not working anymore. There's no shame in the game. <newline>  <newline> As I have gotten older, I've noticed that my BO changes during certain days right before my period begins. Take magnesium supplements and a supplement called Lycopene. You can purchase it online. Taking magnesium and lycopene during your luteal phase consistently really has improved a lot of my symptoms, including cystic acne. <newline>  <newline> For period cramps, I use Hot Hand Super Warmers. I buy a box from Amazon once a year. They are the perfect size and great to pack if you travel.. <newline>  <newline> If you don't already know this, you can track what phase you are in by observing your discharge. During your follicular phase and thru ovulation, it will be quite milky. During your luteal phase, it will be clear. <newline>  <newline> It's important to have your friends and partner informed and aware. There's a book that I think was published in 2017 that helps with the scientific part. Another book that I highly recommend, is ""the woman code"". If you live by ""the woman code"" it will greatly improve your cycles. I'm not dedicated enough but it has helped a friend of mine, dealing with PCOS, to finally get pregnant. Her husband has an Instagram account called @mealssheeats  . <newline>  <newline> Tbh the best thing I ever did was get on a mood stabilizer, then address my irritability, insomnia, binge eating, and hair loss. I take Prozac, trazadone, straterra, and spiranolactone. <newline>  <newline> I've also noticed a profound life changing difference in my anxiety when I microdosed psilocybin, so much so, that I invested into growing my own at home. <newline>  <newline> Best of luck to you all, love yourself, remember it's temporary, and go easy on yourself.

1086;v23byn;Very bad PMDD cycle. Feeling hopeless.;I was recently diagnosed with PMDD a few months ago following a horrible mental breakdown I had. Ever since that month, I’ve been doing pretty well, but now it seems that feeling is back. It’s been going on for about a week and some change now, and I’m due for my period any day.   <newline>  <newline> I feel extremely disconnected to my fiancé, almost like I have no emotions towards him, even though he’s my favorite person in the world and has made my life so much better. It doesn’t help that he is in the military stationed all the way across the world, so we’ve been long distance. But the fact that I feel this way (or lack of feelings more so) makes me feel physically sick, because he’s basically the center of my world. We’re supposed to get married next year and move in together at the end of this year, but I can’t even feel excited right now.  <newline>  <newline> I also have no interest in any of my hobbies. I don’t even find joy scrolling through tiktok. I just want to sleep it all away and even just disappear. I don’t feel like myself at all.  <newline>  <newline> Aside from the mental symptoms which are by far the worst component in this, I’ve been having cramps and nausea even though I’m not even on my period yet.  <newline>  <newline> I know this will all probably go away soon, but something in my head is telling me I will feel this way forever, and I seriously cannot take it anymore.

What if our cups are full due to trauma (whether we are aware of this or not), and the hormone change is the trigger that means our cup starts running over and we can no longer deal with everyday stressors. PMDD would be a manifestation of trauma for us, in the same way that an autoimmune illness might be a different manifestation for someone else. <newline>  <newline> And maybe the type of trauma that we have and/or our genetic makeup dictates the symptoms/diseases that we manifest?

1096;uchcdv;my experience 3 cycles now w/ using Allegra;Hi everyone. I promised I would give this 3 cycles to fully form my opinion on the experimental usage of Allegra for PMDD for myself. This is my personal experience and I'm obviously not a medical professional, so this is not advice. <newline>  <newline> If you didn't see my 2 previous posts, I started taking Allegra 24 hr non drowsy as soon as I felt the shift into PMDD. Typically this is 8 days out before my period. I am one of those people who actually loves ovulation, high estrogen feels great for me, it's the drop in it + rise in progesterone that make me feel awful. The two months prior to now were a huge success, symptoms reduced by 75% and my migraines I used to get for 2 days leading up to my period stopped as well.  <newline>  <newline> This was my third cycle, I got my period today so it's officially been enough time for me to personally assess what attributed to what. There is most definitely a connection to histamine for my PMDD personally.  Though interestingly enough, I have taken Benadryl, and Hydroxyzine in the past and did not have any luck. This lead me to look into why other symptoms I didn't think were connected to PMDD were also improving. I landed at MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) and now I am scheduled with specialists to get evaluated for it. MCAS might be worth looking into if you are apart of the group on here that saw a big improvement when using h1/h2 blockers as that is part of the foundational treatment for MCAS.

1101;u3s719;Psilocybin doses planned according to hormonal cycle;I’ve seen that a lot of people suffering from PMDD have noticed improvements with microdosing (and macrodosing) psilocybin. However, I’m wondering how dosing during different parts of the hormonal cycle can affect the experience/effectiveness of the “trip.” I have some experiences with microdosing that varied a lot and I’m wondering if it has to do with when I took the doses. I plan on doing an experiment with this over the summer when I don’t have classes, but if anyone has some experience with this I’d love to hear. <newline>  <newline> I was inspired by @ghosted_1996 on Instagram, so all credit to her for pointing this out.;LMX1Bitch;False;10;0.88;2022-04-14 21:42:38;/r/PMDD/comments/u3s719/psilocybin_doses_planned_according_to_hormonal/;pmdd
1102;u165po;Sudden sadness and period;"Hi!! I've always suffered from irregular period and anxiety panic attacks etc... In December I had the worst month ever, my ocd was unbearable and it all went away after my period came. I was so good after that. I couldn't believe I was finally happy and February and March were amazing months for me. I found peace, finally. I knew that my period was coming in April, after its usual late month, and it came a week earlier than expected. I was fine but during the second day of bleeding everything was ooooof. I felt depressed, my ocd came back. I was on tiktok watching a video of a girl who died of suicide and my mind went "" omg what if you'll do that too?"" And it all went really bad. Now I'm on my 5th day of period, I'm crying almost every minute and I don't know why i feel like that. I can't stop. And I feel even more crazy cause everyone here says that when they have their period it usually stops. I'm so sad cause I thought I was Finally doing fine.

1104;tyrfm3;At What Age Did You Get Diagnosed With PMDD?;I recently looked up at what age women with pmdd get diagnosed, and the it’s usually at around 26 years of age. So now I am curious because I was diagnosed at age 16, and I most likely had years before I had been diagnosed (my first period was at age 11) <newline>  <newline> I was recently going through my memories on snapchat and I realized my mental health started “slipping” severely 2 years before my diagnosis. <newline>  <newline> Anyways, at what age did you get diagnosed?;Jealous-Shower5106;False;26;1.0;2022-04-08 00:52:58;/r/PMDD/comments/tyrfm3/at_what_age_did_you_get_diagnosed_with_pmdd/;pmdd
1105;twtp2g;Hormonal Changes Causing Real Life Issues;Note: I've been officially diagnosed with anxiety, major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. <newline>  <newline>  <newline> A few days ago I noticed myself starting to feel emotional, more specifically depressed and sad. Ever day felt like I was in a fog. The fog was small at first, but continued to grow more dense. I hoped it was just the sad rescue animal story I was watching on YouTube at that moment, but yesterday my emotions were full-blown crying fits. <newline>  <newline> I sobbed, and yes I mean sobbed, all day yesterday. I found myself on the ground, in the fetal position in my back yard sobbing when trying to simply water my flowers. I picked myself up, went inside and tried to paint. A hobby that usually brings so much joy. The sobbing started again. Again and again I tried to shake it off, but it wouldn't stop. I took a break and tried to do other things, but I just kept crying uncontrollably all day. I got a few things done, but it was only because my body allowed me 10-20 minute breaks free of crying.  <newline>  <newline> It's 5am and I've already been awake for about an hour. No joke, I was woken up purely to cry. I don't know why my body is doing this. It's never been this bad! <newline>  <newline> In February my new doctor put me on Loestrin, a hormonal birth control, after I told him my emotions were getting worse and I'd lost 5 jobs since November. I've even had employers tell me they're letting me go because the stress makes me snap at people. I've had a successful 20 year career in marketing and advertising, so this is a huge blow... <newline> I told the doctor about my emotions and how each job seems to end right around the same point in the month when my hormones change.  <newline>  <newline> The hormonal birth control he put me on sent me into waves of emotions just like I'm experiencing now. I knew I needed to get off it. After 20 days of taking the medication I called his office in a full blown panic attack. I told them how the intrusive thoughts wouldn't stop and I was an emotional wreck. I'd even lost my job for telling my new boss his idea was stupid. Something I'd never say normally bluntly like that 😭...  <newline>  <newline> The doctor had me come into his office and I instantly asked if anything he'd prescribed me could be mixing badly with each other. He looked through his list for what seemed the first time and found a note from our last meeting.  <newline> My hormones were a mess and I'd also been bleeding for 15 days at that point. He looked at his notes and noticed I was previously on Yaz. He asked why he switched my medication. I told him I had no idea but I did tell him I couldn't be on any birth control that had hormones in it because of my sensitivity. The doctor then tells me to stop taking the birth control he previously gave. Within days I felt normal again... <newline>  <newline> That was 2 weeks of freedom through out the last bit of March, but now the emotional rollercoaster is back. <newline> I'm exhausted!  <newline> I don't leave my house! My best friend pulled me out of the house for the first time in a month on Saturday... <newline> I can't keep a job! <newline> I'm financially broke! <newline> I feel like I'm losing my mind and have no idea what to do. I need advice, I need help! <newline>  <newline> I've now contacted an attorney to start the process for disability.  <newline>  <newline> This all is making me far more depressed than normally because I'm losing a career I worked so hard to build. I used to be excited by the prospects of working on a major marketing campaign. Now I can hardly pull myself out of bed. Any career related topics bring me to instant depression. 😭 Friends have recommended I try other career options, maybe something less stressful, but I can't even leave my bed most days.  <newline>  <newline> What's wrong with my brain?

1107;tmixmk;I have no one friends and no one likes me.. A childhood friend blocked me a few days ago after we haven't spoken in years and it just proves what a screw up and loser I am. im slowly losing all my friends, all these rejections hurt, i wonder why i am not good enough?;Hi all. I am so so sad and so lonely. I am very alone.ts honestly so dull and horrible to live life so alone. I dont have a boyfriend, no friends, not really close with my family (a lot of them are toxic). A lot of my friends in the past were very toxic and put me down so i had to cut them out. I noticed especially now getting older, my pool of friend has shrunken rapidly. To the point where i have no friends now. Only a few online friends i speak to here and there. <newline>  <newline> Im on my period and feeling very fragile and down and sad. I just needed to vent.  I feel horrible. im losing all my friends as time goes by. It feels somewhat traumatic. Even my online friends with exception of two have been less responsive to me. I think its simply just friendship dying out and them being less interested in our friendship. I notice how we sort of run out of things to talk about  or maybe im draining because i have so many stress on me. <newline>  <newline> I had one childhood friend block me on FB recently, i think she may have thought i was not interested in the friendship since we havent talked in a very long time. I think part of it is my fault or she doesnt like me anymore. I think my mental problems have made me not the best friend. :( i have severe depression and i experienced traumatic events over the years that made me withdraw from relationships and went on for months not speaking to people close to me because i barely had energy to even type. but i still thought about them and hoped they were okay while feeling guilty. <newline>  <newline>  I was thinking about my childhood and my childhood friends. I missed her,  but i feel like our friendship slowly died out, we messaged each other less and less. I would be the one doing most of the reaching out after a while, she would reply but her replies didnt seem engaging. Though she did tag me in a post and i commented on it and  she told me how she missed me so much (she moved to another state a long time ago)in response that was her last message to me which was about two years ago or three.   <newline>  <newline> Though i also had thoughts that maybe she was not really into the friendship she never reached out to me after that and now i see she removed and blocked me from facebook. I think i shouldnt be suprised since we havent talked in like two or three years and it doesnt feel like we are friends. Tbh, i sort of stopped reaching out to her because I felt like she was not into our conversations or talking to me. Now i am blocked and removed. Maybe she thought the same and thats why i was blocked. I was planning to reach out to her soon before she blocked me and apologize for not messaging her more often and being honest on why but she blocked me which shows she does not want to communicate or even hear me out. <newline>  <newline> I saw she made posts on her FB recently about feeling hurt by toxic friends and how she hated how a lot of her friends only come around when they needed something. I hope she didnt think i was like that :( its too late now. , now its all gone. <newline>  <newline> My other friendships are dying too. i had a friend who died recently, but he was more  absorbed in his alcohol addiction than our friendship to keep in touch, he stopped replying to me after we got back in touch and died a year and half later :( and i had a fight with another childhood friend that caused our relationship to perish. i found out she was toxic and i felt i had to remove her. i sort of regret that now. Then i had another girl who i was friends with in highschool that was very flaky and would reach out to  me every few years saying she misses me and wants to hang out but whenever i said i was free, she never response back or make so many excuses to avoid me. yet i saw her hanging out with her other friends. that was the last straw. It didnt make sense, she  keeps doing this for years so i told her off and then chose to remove her from my life too <newline>  <newline> I feel so horrible.  I am so lame, i am not interesting, funny, im not good looking, im not popular. I have nothing to offer to people its why people stop talking to me. There is nothing interesting about me that keeps people interested in being my friend or to reach out to me.  All of this rejection hurts so bad. <newline>  <newline> i also feel like a contradiction too, maybe i pushed some people away without realizing due to my low self esteem and depression. I tried to go into therapy and treatment, but it still an ongoing battle. It seems no matter what i just cant be happy, relaxed etc... i feel like i just bore and bother people when i message them <newline>  <newline> I think i have to accept im not people material and not suited for friends or relationships and that i was destined to be a loner. But it hurts oh so bad. Maybe im hanging on to the past and dont want to let go.

1109;tjstob;newly diagnosed, lurker here - some queries and some thanks;Hello all!  <newline>  <newline> Since I've been newly diagnosed here I've posted, commented here and there. I've found great comfort in knowing I am not alone - even though it makes me sad you all go through this.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Today my wonderful GYN told me to chat with my new psychiatrist and to pair them up to get me some kind of help. I can't take SSRIs due to my body not metabolizing them properly.  <newline> I have extremely heavy periods that are so intensely painful that I often vomit and have been known to pass out in the past. After more and more testing recently, it's been found out that I do not have PCOS. And she doesn't think I have endometriosis either. She suspects that the PMDD is to blame and that between that and my hashimoto's disease, they just exacerbate each other constantly. I also have ADHD and OCD. With my obsessive compulsive disorder my main fears are sudden death by stroke or heart attack, illness, etc. You can imagine when one is feeling hyper anxious during that ovulation time - how much it can feed into those deep fears.  <newline>  <newline> At times I am terrified for no reason. Impending doom. Deeply sad. Sometimes incredibly angry and irrational. I have maybe a good week a month. I can always track when my hormones will fluctuate and know things are about to get dark or extremely anxiety inducing.  <newline>  <newline> Things I am sure that you guys have all read here over and over again. I don't mean to complain at all. Part of me feel so hopeful and part of me feels so hopeless.  <newline>  <newline> I do want to thank you all from the absolute bottom of my heart. I am getting acclimated to Reddit and since I've deleted my Facebook and spent more time on here, I have found that these communities have been so much more supportive than I've been able to find. You are all wonderful and I'm proud of all of you. If you have any advice or wish to take this as a way to commiserate or not feel alone, I encourage a comment or two. I love to feel that I am not alone as well.

1110;thvvep;PMDD and multiple personalities?;"I see a lot of posts on here where people describe their experiences of PMDD as being like having multiple personalities. This is also my experience and something I have been exploring with my therapist and I wanted to get other people's takes on it. <newline>  <newline> We often describe the people we become during hell week as monsters, with completely different takes on life than who we are the rest of the month - for me this person has a reduced capacity for experiencing pleasure (anhedonia, no interest in my usual hobbies/activities) has very negative/critical opinions of things/identifies problems all the time, and engages in a lot of negative self talk, etc. <newline>  <newline> In DID they'd call that person a persecutory alter. You can look it up - you might relate to it? <newline>  <newline> Another kind of alter I experience with PMDD is the caregiver. my persecutory alter hates the caregiver alter (the person that tries to make me, for example, get up in the morning, feed myself, give myself affirmation, self sooth etc) and pushes them away, which obviously makes life hard when the persecutory alter is fronting. <newline>  <newline> I see a lot of people saying that when hell week start and ends they can feel a ""switch"", a moment when the mood drops/raises and the internal mental landscape changes dramatically. <newline>  <newline> This sounds a lot like when personalities switch with DID. <newline>  <newline> I also notice I have a sort of amnesia sometimes - never as complete as it is for people with DID - I often can't remember the low moods, and the ""happy"" version of me often thinks that the struggles of the persecutory alter are funny, silly, over dramatic, and invalid. And the persecutory alter thinks that the other me is naive, unaware of the trials of life, and blissfully ignorant.  <newline>  <newline> Anyways, how can this all be helpful? Well, I myself, used to hate on the persecutory alter loads - I saw them as an inhuman monster, who I wanted to purge from myself. I see a lot of people with the same sentiment towards the person them become during the luteal phase. <newline>  <newline> I've trying out using knowledge of DID to think of it differently - this person I become is actually just doing their best to cope with the low moods, and although their methods are unhelpful (the negative self talk does more harm than good) they are trying to protect us, all on their own - because the other parts of my personality retreat when they show up (hence that feeling of depersonalisation, feeling like I'm watching my life from the back of my mind). calling them a monster just alienates them further - they feel unable to communicate with ""happy"" me, to access or remember good memories/the idea that things will get better, and that happy me exists and will get to front again soon. they dont believe that i will be happy again, and they also dont care - because they get locked away during the rest of the month, they themself never actually get to experience enjoyment or nice memories. I've been trying to coax them out on good days and build a better relationship between everyone. <newline>  <newline> I've been trying to improve all the relationships between the different parts of myself with my therapist. I do actually believe that PMDD, and possibly other mood disorders, can create barriers in the mind, almost like separate personalities, and learning how to function as a person with multiple personality components and states, could actually help my pmdd. <newline>  <newline> so yeah. what do you think? could this be a helpful way of looking at PMDD? or is this bad, and would encourage further splits in the personality? idk. do you guys relate to any of this? <newline>  <newline> oh yeah - a last compelling bit of evidence - I experience a weird feeling of loss when I think about being cured of PMDD and not seeing that part of me again. I feel like part of my personality has grown around, and become indistinguishable from, the low moods, and I don't want to lose their memories, experiences, wisdom, or personality. I would like for all of my personality to be more integrated, not just for me to be permanently the happy version of me. <newline>  <newline> (sorry that was long and unstructured I kind of want to make a youtube video on this or something)";sunshineispretty;False;8;0.78;2022-03-19 14:04:23;/r/PMDD/comments/thvvep/pmdd_and_multiple_personalities/;pmdd
1111;thg9q8;The PMDD purge;I'm an organized person and not very materialistic, but PMDD seems to take it to new levels.  Almost every time my PMDD starts to set in, I get an overwhelming urge to get rid of nearly everything.  Like, I want to be an extreme minimalist who can fit all her clothes in a suitcase and everything she owns in a closet if she had to compile it. <newline>  <newline> The thing is, though (and I have to remind myself of this *very* often,) is that I live with my parents and am generally confined to one room, that I live in a place where temperatures vary almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year, and that my hobbies are my coping mechanism for my mental health.  I also have the sweetest little bird who needs space for her cage and supplies.  Once I get my own place, I'll have a coat closet and a hobby spot and storage for extra blankets and childhood stuffed animals (I don't have a lot, but they do take up space in my closet haha,) plus my bird can go in the living room. <newline>  <newline> Don't get me wrong - my room is generally very clean and organized with plenty of space.  I don't think I'm a hoarder by any means.

Maybe both.  <newline>  <newline> I feel incredibly heavy with all the Ukraine shit. Not gonna get into it. I try to avoid consuming content about it because I am very sensitive and often feel overwhelmed. But it’s EVERYWHERE. on instagram, on zoom calls, on the news in passing.

There is so much panic and paranoia and resentment. We’re inching towards total lockdown and I am freaking out because I wfh ech week and each weekend I “risk” it by going to see my bf and stay there for the weekend. I do this to reduce time on public transport and be more efficient with my trips. Anyway I feel bad when I go out cuz I stay with my very strong and healthy but elderly father. So i really don’t want him to get sick. But I also can’t stay home the whole time with him.  <newline>  <newline> Then my work. I work on projects and right now one of the people who is kind of my boss is a steamrolling dickhead. I hate him.

I have a blister that got infected as all I do is walk now that everything is closed. I practiced yoga for the first time in months and I was so weak and tight. For context, I used to be a yoga teacher before I got injured and life took over my fitness lifestyle. So that was shit. I’ve become more sedentary than ever so I feel out of shape. I can’t go to the salon to fix my hair so my roots are looking crazy. I have a bob haircut which is overgrown too.

1113;t3axpe;Good resources on eating for INSATIABLE hunger?;Hi all,  <newline>  <newline> I've had a new PMDD symptom kick in for me in the past few months that's been pretty debilitating. Extreme hunger. I want to emphasis that it's not CRAVINGS. I don't get the sugar/junk food cravings a lot of people get.  <newline>  <newline> Instead, it's a physical, gnawing hunger that will literally wake me up at night. I eat very healthily and focus on getting enough protein, but that doesn't seem to help a whole lot. Occasionally I've tried just going the opposite direction and indulging in burgers, fries etc. to take in a whole bunch of calories, but I've also been told that's bad and can mess up your hunger signals more.  <newline>  <newline> I'm looking for good resources on how to eat to address this. (Can't afford to go to a dietitian.) Does anyone have any instagram account they follow, book, podcast etc. that they love for this kind of thing? Looking for accessible ideas since I don't have the time or money to be cooking elaborate meals all day.  <newline>  <newline> Also, if anyone else has insatiable hunger tied to their hormones and has found a solution please let me know!

1116;st7anz;Hey, I'm new and I need to drain;"First of all: spanish is my native language. I couldn't find PMDD groups so here I am. Sorry for the bad english. <newline>  <newline> Well... I'm 25 years old, all of them has being affected by my period. The last thing that happened to me was rejecting a good job for a depresive crisis, naussea,  dizziness, back pain, headache,  irritability  etc...  My period has affected my relationships with other jobs. I can say that all of the jobs I quited had something to do with my period. <newline>  <newline> Has affected all of my previous romantic relationships. Is affecting my marriage. <newline>  <newline> Things got better if you compare it to ten years ago. Meditation, quitting alcohol, keeping a routine especially related to sleep schedules, reducing so much social media (no facebook, no instagram, no tik tok but especially NO TWITTER) except for Pinterest and Reddit (yay), reducing time exposed to screen, writting on paper etc etc... <newline>  <newline> I've been diagnosed with anxiety at 17 years old but I don't like to take pills. Not that I don't believe or recomend it, it's just that I don't like the side effects. There was a time when I took anxiolytics and birth control at the same time... Still. <newline>  <newline> In this moment I have no appetite, I barely have ate. All I had done is cry. I've had crying episodes. But the worst of all is the depresive episodes. <newline>  <newline> I feel like I am not useful. I can't keep a job. I can't keep a healthy relationship. I leave everyone down. I have hurtful toughts like I don't even want to keep trying, like I can't archieve anything because I don't have the constance to make it. And I'm embarrased to say this but I sometimes feel envy. When there is another girl bragging about how awesome her job is, how much has grown or how much time she has been there my first reaction is feel envy. <newline>  <newline> But deep down I have the awareness to know that there is nothing wrong with the other person and instead I feel deeply bad with myself.

I thought it was because I had started doing more cardio again.  Well, then I got my period.  The first day was fine, but the second and third day have found me just feeling broken.  I even did a 15 minute workout off YouTube today (the third day) to try to feel better, I cried through half of it!  Usually the fourth day is my turning point so tomorrow will be better.

1122;scoyie;So, I made this post in a Facebook group earlier today…. I’m so lost;I’m sorry everyone, but I desperately need to vent. I’m having a mental break down right now as I’ve gone into my Doctors office religiously complaining about my issues with all this. Including my awful, persistent, swollen and sore lower stomach. Five years I’ve gone in there, five years I’ve complained about it. Finally on my appointment on the 23rd of December I told my doctor I think it’s potentially serious and my whole life has been flipped over by this. So when I told them on the 23rd I desperately wanted to see a gynaecologist and I felt I needed one. Today I had a strange feeling in my gut, so I called every gynaecologist in the local province. Not one referral was made to not one gynaecologist. They all told me they received nothing… my doctor never even sent one when I was told they did. So, what the hell do I do? I’m breaking completely.  <newline> Before that, Wednesday evening of last week I went to the ER in pain for the same issues mentioned above. I waited eight and half hours to see a doctor after mentioning and being very clear I needed one. By the time I was even seen I wasn’t even given a doctor. Just a newly registered nurse that was rude to me for no reason and cutting me off and telling me everything I was saying was all in my head. After this nurse noticed my 10+ year old self made scars that I no longer deal with I was interrogated with, “Are you seeing a psychiatrist, who was it, when it was, who it was, what it was for, what they said, when I’ll be seeing one and if I’m currently seeing one etc”. I was sent home in pain with no prescriptions, no referral nothing. Is this where I just throw in the towel? I’ve sent complaints to human rights and collage of physicians because I’m losing my entire will to even fight for myself or even live… what am I doing wrong?;SarahLudlow;False;3;1.0;2022-01-25 21:53:33;/r/PMDD/comments/scoyie/so_i_made_this_post_in_a_facebook_group_earlier/;pmdd

1125;sa8pwy;Skills to Manage PMDD;Hey friends! I appreciate this page so much! I just wanted to take some time today and share a few things that help me get through the depressive stages and hope it might help some of you! <newline>  <newline> 1.) getting on birth control or medication  <newline>  <newline> I have the implant in my arm! Some doctors have recommended hormonal birth control to regulate my moods. I have definitely noticed a difference. I first had the implant put in when I was 18. A few years later I took it out for 6 months to see how my symptoms would be. Definitely was worse off of birth control than on birth control.  <newline>  <newline> I also hear getting on a low dose of anti depressants can help some people too! It just doesn’t work for me but I will not discount it for those it will work for!  <newline>  <newline> I know that’s not an option for everyone and it doesn’t work for everyone, but if you’re able I’d suggest it. <newline>  <newline> 2.) DBT therapy  <newline>  <newline> Dialectical behavioral therapy. “is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy tries to identify and change negative thinking patterns and pushes for positive behavioral changes.” <newline>  <newline> One of my main struggles with the depression swings is my thought patterns. It’s so easy to let myself spiral and not know how to stop. DBT helped me learn to identify the triggering thoughts and how to do a full stop to redirect my thinking.  <newline>  <newline> I can feel like a totally different person when I’m beginning my cycle. Anger and sadness overwhelming. Learning to identify what is triggering the anger or sadness and how to cope has been very helpful! <newline>  <newline> YouTube has a lot of helpful DBT skills and how to implement them but I suggest a therapist if it is an option! <newline>  <newline> 3.) talking to those I trust  <newline>  <newline> I think my main fear with PMMD is hurting those around me. Being combative and lashing out over things that feel so intense in the moment but trivial after 😅 telling the people around me about my symptoms and having their support is amazing! My family went to therapy with me so they know ways to help me come back to myself and my boyfriend is extremely supportive. I know not everyone has supportive people, but even one person who understands is so helpful! I can’t speak for everyone in the group but please message me if you just need support! <newline>  <newline> 4.) exercise/ physical release  <newline>  <newline> I have noticed that physically exerting myself is a game changer. Our bodies are a full unit. We are not just hormones or a brain, PMMD effects the whole body. So Boxing, rock climbing, going for a run, screaming in the car to loud music, punching a pillow. Letting out anger is necessary! Find what let’s you just unload. Anything that won’t hurt you or others is fair game. Screw social propriety and stigma. Don’t let that hold you back. Just let it all out!  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> 5.) it’s not forever  <newline>  <newline> Reminding myself this too shall pass. That it is not gonna last forever. Just letting myself exist as I am now and feel what I need to feel. Sometime there is peace in acceptance.  <newline>  <newline> I am not in charge of my feelings but I do have control over how I respond to the feelings. I can choose to stop and walk away from a stressor, I can choose to go for a walk or watch a movie I love or scream in a pillow <newline>  <newline>  <newline> We will make mistakes and we will mess up from time to time but we are human. Be kind to yourself !  <newline>  <newline> I love you all and I hope it helps a bit!;Ah-wools;False;14;1.0;2022-01-22 18:27:37;/r/PMDD/comments/sa8pwy/skills_to_manage_pmdd/;pmdd

1128;rrlqjv;[tw: depression, suicide,anger] Just had a frustrating obgyn appointment;"I wrote a large thread on Twitter so I need to piece it together here . Sorry if it's clunky. I'm still super upset  not cause I didn't get my way but because I felt so..unheard : <newline>  <newline> Angry at the moment prob shouldn't tweet but I will. I just had an obgyn appointment and brought up oophorectomy since I am suffering badly from PMDD physically. I knew it was a long shot but I just wanted to talk it out. Emotionally has been better with alot of medications and time. I was shut down pretty quick due to age, I am 35. So I brought Up..""well on the flip side am I not too old to get pregnant by some standards"" and she said well yes it is difficult. <newline>  <newline> So I can't win. I assured her I have no desire to ever be pregnant and talked at lengths with my partner about biological children being important or not. <newline>  <newline> She told me again not an option and wants me to go to a PMDD clinic for possible other meds.  Medications help with mental, not physical. And I've been thru it all. She was nice and listened but at the end of the day, medical professionals still have no idea how to handle PMDD <newline>  <newline> And I am at my wits ends. Half of my year is spent suffering ( usually two weeks out of every month) how is that fair ? This needs to be taken more seriously. Women with PMDD sometimes resort to suicide or get addicted to drugs, I imagine for the reasons I described above, deadends. <newline>  <newline> I don't know how or where to start, but today flipped a switch  I need to advocate for this. No not necessarily full oophorectomies, but more research and compassion. Physical suffering triggers mental health.  <newline> So I may be better initially mentally with sadness, suicide ideation, and absolute rage, but the more days I am nausea, have night sweats that require sleeping on towels, migraines,and fatigue..I circle back to being angry and short tempered. Something needs to be done.

1129;rgqhs0;Go easy on yourself!;I know it's hard. I made it three weeks doing well. 7 days to go and it hits me like a train. To constantly fight only makes it worse. I've come to accept this laundry list of symptoms as hormone related and not  reality.  <newline>  <newline> You're still doing good! You're still in the game. Don't trust your thoughts. Don't buy into intrusive memories, worst case scenarios and nightmares. Hormones can be a bitch, it's very real but what they tell you isn't. You're not ugly, doomed and incapable.  <newline>  <newline> For me this time of the month screams at me to doubt myself. But I let it remind me that others go through the same. I just want you to not beat yourself up over how sluggish and sick and negative you might feel.  <newline>  <newline> Have your own back. Don't expect anyone to understand or validate your struggle. Commit to whatever makes you feel better. Even if it's taking a nap or watching YouTube videos. I know it's not want you truly want because you can and usually do so much more. But I think it's the judgment of what we do during this time that makes it the worst. The expectation that we should just function like usual. <newline>  <newline> I just want you to know that nothing happened. You're not losing your mind. It's not all going down the drain.

1131;r3ksnk;Hyperfixation that lasts until end of period?;I was diagnosed with PMDD when I was 26. It’s mostly just been bouts of rage, exhaustion and insecurity. Ever since I turned 35 this year, I’ve noticed that I’ve had an insane amount of hyperfixation about 5 days before my period and then it lasts until a day or two AFTER my period ends. Is that normal? Like it could be a person (I.e looking at my husband’s ex’s Instagram) or it could be something health related. Mostly it’s been skin cancer because I went tanning a few times when I was younger. Sometimes it is all consuming and I can’t eat or sleep and I’m constantly checking Instagram or my body. I’ve been to three different doctors for my skin and I feel like they all missed something. I feel too old to be acting this way. Lol but it’s literally only associated with my cycle.

1133;qplojs;Is medical gaslighting silencing those with PMDD?;I've had PMDD since I was 14 but didn't know it. At 38, after having suicidal thoughts as I was folding laundry, I knew something was waaay off. I did the research and realized I had PMDD. I met with several therapists and finally found one I liked and had several appointments with an OBGYN, but not once was my PMDD and skills to cope and manage ever addressed. The only things that helped keep the suicidal thoughts at bay were acupuncture, diet, and exercise.  My goal was just to live. I didn't know how to improve the other symptoms of depression, anger/rage, hopelessness, irritation, etc. So, I chugged along on the mental hamster wheel, having at most 1.5 good weeks going from a normal week to low to extremely low every month. I never fully understood why I couldn't stay committed to my goals, maintain a healthy relationship, or make substantive progress in any area of life. <newline>  <newline> I am 45 now, and my PMDD has come back with a vengeance. I realize that I've had this since I was a young teen, but the symptoms manifested differently (for example, between ages 14-19, I was mostly depressed and hopeless on a cyclical basis). Oh, the relationships I lost and the pain I suffered. <newline>  <newline> The good news is I am far more informed today than I've ever been, and I am determined to FIGHT for my life and thrive! I look at my teen nieces and know that I would never want them to suffer as I did. I will do what I can to advocate for change and help others who suffer from this. <newline>  <newline> Yesterday, I came across this video on youtube. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share the link, but you can look it up on youtube with the same title as this post.

1136;qm0ntp;Some resources I’ve shared with the PMDD forum on Inspire that may help!;Hi everyone — Hope we’re all coping and taking it easy. I just wanted to post a few resources I’ve been using that I’ve found help me feel in control and safe during my menstrual cycle. The scariest thing for me is the spiral that comes during the luteal phase (shudder), so I am making a conscious effort to lay down some groundwork during the follicular phase while I’m functional. Let me know if anyone has tried these and if they’ve been met with success! This condition often feels so hopeless and isolating, but these online communities have bolstered my confidence and given me the bravery I need to endure another cycle. I hope this helps some of you!  <newline>  <newline> - I recently stopped drinking, and I REALLY did not want to. I’m 25 years old and at this time in my life, alcohol is still playing a prominent role in my social life. However, I feel so much better. I’ll have one drink during my follicular phase occasionally, but avoid it entirely during the luteal phase. I did not realize how much I was drinking and found I had minor withdrawal symptoms, but my psychiatrist was able to prescribe a short term medication to help with any panic attacks <newline> - The apps Moody, Me Vs. PMDD, and Stardust are all wonderful, but Moody is by far my favorite. I’m unsure if it is available on Android, but for my fellow iPhone users it is in the App Store. It has mindfulness, movement, mood tracking, symptom tracking, and dietary suggestions depending on where you are in your cycle. I highly recommend.  <newline> - I follow a PMDD même page on Instagram (lol) and the administrator has found success with 10 mg of famitodine in the morning during her luteal phase. Disclaimer: please run any new medications by your doctor. This is an antihistamine, so be wary if you are taking other medications for allergies. Famitodine is sold as Pepcid in the US and if available as an OTC drug, but in the UK, I think you need a prescription  <newline> - Worry lists: recommended to me by my therapist, this has been a life saver. I just stream of consciousness write down all my thoughts, even if I think they are crazy, and it provides SOME relief. This is definitely not a cure all, but if you’re in the middle of a freak out it can be grounding <newline> - if you have the ability I cannot stress enough how empowering and helpful having a therapist and psychiatrist have been. I’ve been medicated for my PMDD for six years, first with fluoxetine and now with Zoloft, and I feel as though I am finding some relief. It doesn’t get rid of the mood swings, but tightens the margin of how high or low my mood can go.  <newline> - I drink water obsessively. I love hydration aids, especially nuun vitamins — I didn’t realize how much my water intake influences my mood. I hate it when people are like JuSt DrInK wAtEr because it feels like it minimizes the problem, but it actually does help  <newline>  <newline> If anyone has any additional suggestions please drop them in the comments below.

1139;qd2mip;Histamine Intolerance;Hey all, <newline>  <newline> I know there has been a lot of talking about histamines here so I wanted to share a [link to this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPMK2j6RKI) I found if it might be helpful to anyone looking to learn more.  In this she outlines why you can have histamine intolerance (meaning your body produces too much histamine and your body cannot handle it). Histamines are good for your body and immune system but too much can lead to the anxiety, migraines, insomnia, allergic feelings, fatigue and brain fog, and GI issues, etc. that we experience with PMDD. I'm currently in hell week so this really was eye-opening for me.  <newline>  <newline> What I found really interesting was all of the things that can increase histamines, such as taking ibuprofen, antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, the foods we eat, leaky gut and most of all ESTROGEN DOMINANCE. Basically, the DAO enzyme lives in your gut to break down histamines but that **DAO enzyme decreases during ovulation when your estrogen peaks at its highest**. So high estrogen=low DAO=high histamines. Also histamine stimulates the ovaries to make more estrogen, so its a shit cycle! <newline>  <newline> In addition to cleaning up your diet (decrease fermented foods during luteal phase but she also has a histamine lowering diet in the description) and getting more sleep, she does outline some supplements that can help to take during your luteal phase: vitamin c, simplify a probiotic without specific bacteria strains, and quercetin. <newline>  <newline> Additionally, there is a book out there called [Dirty Genes](https://www.amazon.com/Dirty-Genes-Breakthrough-Program-Optimize/dp/0062698141) which goes into this a lot more if anyone is interested. I know the author also makes supplements that help to support those different enzymes in the body break down histamines, the brand is Seeking Health.  <newline>  <newline> I am super new to all of this and have a lot more research to do and things to try, but if it helpful to anyone I wanted to share.;ESinNM29;False;2;0.75;2021-10-21 22:05:49;/r/PMDD/comments/qd2mip/histamine_intolerance/;pmdd
1140;qb0h97;What would be on your radical self-care list for hell week?;I recently was diagnosed as a HSP (highly sensitive person), which made a big difference in the way I practice self care. I try to take radically good care of myself now, and to listen to my needs. I'm working on applying this to my hell week, which can be so challenging because rationality and honestly even the desire to take care of myself go out of the window. But these are a few of the the things I have:  <newline>  <newline> 1. Stay off of instagram: the comparison trap will kill you.  <newline> 2. This is not the time for deep introspection and life decisions.  <newline> 3. Take frequent breaks from work.  <newline> 4. Rest! Rest over productivity.  <newline> 5. Be vocal if someone hurts my feelings.  <newline> 6. Eat as much as I want. Not the time for calorie tracking.  <newline> 7. Early bedtime.  <newline> 8. Exercise, because it feels so good (and not because I have to).  <newline>  <newline> It's so effed up that the idea of taking deeply good care of ourselves and meeting our needs is considered radical, but for someone who deals with PMDD, I think it's critical.  <newline>  <newline> So I'm curious: What would be on your list? I'm looking for inspiration. <3;Top_Yam5054;False;28;0.99;2021-10-19 01:05:24;/r/PMDD/comments/qb0h97/what_would_be_on_your_radical_selfcare_list_for/;pmdd

1145;q0d99q;Just rambling mostly (TW for discussion of past SelfH. and ideations);"Trying to sort my thoughts out. I think I feel like I'm beginning my luteal depression phase in my cycle... I can usually tell 2 or 3 days beforehand because I'll start getting bored and stir crazy. Things I was enjoying (like a video game for example) are suddenly not interesting and feels like time just crawls. <newline>  <newline> I'm just kind of worried whether I *am* getting ready to have a period or not, because I'm back on the BCP I was on for years with success preventing most of my symptoms (and cycles, as it does). Earlier this year my doc and I were discussing an alternative birth control to try that I wouldn't risk days of forgetting to take it or taking it late in the day. I already tried Mirena IUD and it did nothing for me, she told me about the EluRing though and I decided to try. <newline>  <newline> It did alright for the 6 or so months I was on it instead of the pill, had more ""breakthrough"" symptoms than I did on the pill but didn't think it was too bad to outweigh the benefit of not having to risk forgetting to take a pill. The last 2-3 months though it seemed to basically stop doing anything for me and I had some surprise periods, which I wasn't expecting and unfortunately drove myself crazy wondering why I was suddenly depressed again... Until I started bleeding, then it would make sense to me. <newline>  <newline> I talked to my doc again and we switched back to the pill... She told me I wait until I was due to remove the EluRing normally, then do nothing for a week to let my body readjust, or ""reset"" she said... Then after a week I can start the pills again. <newline>  <newline> Well... I didn't listen to her advice... I took the ring out and started the pills again the same day, I remember I was really irritable already before calling her but I didn't want to deal with the symptoms all over again before getting started on the pill again. I know in hindsight I should have listened to her... I think I'm paying for it now/soon. <newline>  <newline> After starting the pill/removing the ring I actually had a period of bleeding for 7 days, which even for my natural cycle is a long time for me. My natural cycle I usually bleed only 3-4 days, so it was a little worrying/confusing... <newline>  <newline> It finally stopped after 7 days of bleeding, and I hoped everything would return back to how it use to be when I was on the pill... I think it did, at least somewhat, but like I said, I'm still wary right now that I'm going to start again soon... I get suicidally depressed before my period starts and it terrifies me that one day I'll be starting a period soon and I'll do something I will majorly regret 😞 <newline>  <newline> I've only ever actually intentionally self harmed once, but the suicidal ideations have ALWAYS been a major part of my life... Even nowadays, while I don't have nearly as much difficulty as I did in my pubescent years, I still tend to have the passive mindset that I'm just staying alive for the other people in my life. I don't necessarily mind that, but I always feel like if I had the choice to die without affecting the people in my life, I would take that chance... <newline>  <newline> I don't really have a fear of death or pain/injury most of the time... I think during my better days I'm more apprehensive but I have a relatively ""carefree"" feeling of ""if something happens to me, well... So be it"" when it comes to getting injured or worse. I don't actively seek out dangerous situations on a daily basis, but I just feel like... I guess I feel like, if I died today, I wouldn't have much to regret maybe? As long as my death isn't not intentional suicide... <newline>  <newline> Ehh, I need to stop going into my ""theatrics""... It helps me a lot to type out all my thoughts during times like this, I could probably write an autobiography in one night lol, but I'd remember something else the next day and it would just keep going and never end! 😅 <newline>  <newline> I'm glad that I found this subreddit. I don't really use Reddit much in general but I really feel like I can empathize much better with the people here. I'm in a few groups on Facebook (one for autistic women, 2 for PMDD) but I don't really post or browse those too much... I'm not sure why, I just feel out of place there... Maybe something to do with the extra anonymity that comes with reddit vs Facebook (I don't think that really matters to me, but I've been surprised many times what I subconsciously feel/think compared to what I believe I do... If that makes sense lol) <newline>  <newline> I know this is a looooong post and I don't expect anyone to read it, but it you did read it then thank you :) I've tried journaling my thoughts like these in private documents but it just doesn't seem to relieve these stress thoughts as well as posting in groups/forums... I think having my thoughts where others could potentially see them is reaffirming in some odd way, for me? 🤷";Wenzerrr;False;0;1.0;2021-10-03 07:48:24;/r/PMDD/comments/q0d99q/just_rambling_mostly_tw_for_discussion_of_past/;pmdd
1146;pypdmt;WHY DOES MY MIND LITERALLY WANT TO RUIN MY LIFE WHEN I'M ON MY LUTEAL PHASE;Alright. So, I know what I am supposed to do, and I generally really like to be a healthy person. I really enjoy yoga, long walks, pilates, I love eating fruits, veggies, and oatmeal, I LOVE my sleep and try to get as much as possible, and I generally like to stay on top of my school assignments, getting things done as early as possible. TELL ME WHY- WHEN I AM ON MY 2+ WEEKS FROM HELL, MY MIND LITERALLY INHIBITS ME FROM DOING ANY OF THESE THINGS. LITERALLY: <newline>  <newline> \- My body refuses to get to sleep before 1-2 even 3 AM. Even when I have to be at work at 5 AM. My mind will literally NOT LET ME. And insists I binge every possible episode of any remotely interesting show on Netflix/Hulu/Youtube. THEN, when it's time to get up, my body simply refuses to do so. I literally have sleep paralysis.  <newline>  <newline> \- Any form of exercise? HA. No way. My mind thinks it's a complete joke. No. Way. My mind will find 5000 things I need to get done instead and then proceed to tell me it's no use and to go ahead and binge an entire cheesecake while watching Cody Ko on youtube. <newline>  <newline> \- Again, I am a pretty balanced eater and understand the importance of balanced meals. Esp during the luteal phase. I should be eating lean proteins. NOPE. Fries, Pasta with TONS of cheese. My mind at lunch today: spicy wings, a bag of sour cream and onion chips, and 2 chocolate chip cookies... PLZ.  <newline>  <newline> \- My mind on schoolwork: NOPE. You're already behind. You're also dumb. Why would you even try to do schoolwork? Eat more cheesecake and give Cody Ko more views. While you're at it, watch him and his girlfriend Kelsey and feel terrible because you're fat, dumb, have NO self control, and OH YEAH- you're single AF and no one has ever and will never love you. <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Anyone else?

1147;pygz5w;Hello I have come back to make my monthly rants;So last night I just started crying cos I was thinking about so much terrible stuff.  <newline>  <newline> Of course I couldn’t just sleep because my PMDD gives me uncontrollable insomnia. Luckily sleeping aids are starting to kick in, but not fast enough.  <newline>  <newline> So I’m just laying there trying to go to sleep and suddenly my brain just brings up images of the most fucked up shit I can imagine (I literally can’t even talk about it because it’s so incredibly triggering).  <newline>  <newline> I have to sit up and try to think of something else. So naturally I start thinking about how useless I am.  <newline>  <newline> I’m really dreading going back to Uni because I haven’t done enough work on my final year project yet (luteal phase to thank for that) and I’m so scared I won’t get it done.  <newline>  <newline> And then at the same time I don’t *want* to work on my final year project because I just straight up don’t like my degree and my career path anymore.  <newline>  <newline> And then I think about how I can’t give up because I need to secure a job and I’m entering a lucrative industry and I can’t throw this opportunity away.  <newline>  <newline> And then I think about my year in industry last year and how terrible I was.  <newline>  <newline> “The job wasn’t bad, you should consider yourself lucky you got such a cushy job, it was perfect for you.” I tell myself… but then why did I have mental breakdowns and burnouts and absolutely dreaded every single day? <newline>  <newline> It’s because I absolutely *hate* the concept of having a job. Any job. Shitty job, great job… I don’t think it would matter. I just don’t want a job. <newline>  <newline> Why don’t I want a job? What would I do instead? <newline>  <newline> I just don’t want to work I want to travel the world and look after my pet mice all day. I want to make YouTube videos about things I like and help people.  <newline>  <newline> “Look at you, you’d be such a disappointment to your ancestors. They worked their fingers to the bone to get a slice of bread for dinner and you’re complaining about not wanting a cushy job.” It’s true. I’m so worthless.  <newline>  <newline> And then I think about how people in society are only judged by their worth i.e. how much they contribute to society. And I think about how terrible of a system this is like no other animal on earth relies on money to survive.  <newline>  <newline> And then I think about how terrible human society is and that nothing is going to change and we’re all gonna die to climate change surrounded by idiots and money hoarders.  <newline>  <newline> And all these thoughts are swirling around my head so what can I do other than cry? And I cried.  <newline>  <newline> I’m so scared for the future. I just don’t know what to do.  <newline>  <newline>  <newline>  <newline> P.S. oh I just started my period… that figures <newline>  <newline> EDIT: I DIDNT EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT THE DREAMS I HAD. (TW: violence) So I fell asleep eventually and then I literally dreamed of watching people getting their face ripped off and getting tortured like getting burned and having a needle put in my hand. And I dreamt that my pet mice were sick and going to die.  <newline>  <newline> Man fuck PMDD.;NotApplicableMC;False;0;1.0;2021-09-30 10:26:35;/r/PMDD/comments/pygz5w/hello_i_have_come_back_to_make_my_monthly_rants/;pmdd

1152;pqd9il;My PMDD is showing itself differently;I got high in trying to deal with my mood, so I apologize for the errors. If you would like clarification, I can do that. <newline>  <newline> Usually when my PMDD comes around there is a very specific anger I get (a buzzing agitation to do something, and the strong urge to throw my phone across the room). I do not *ever* feel this way during any other time. I have to basically close myself off or else I will say something terrible to my spouse and/or wondering if I should leave her. <newline>  <newline> I haven't had the anger I described above, but I've had thoughts of leaving my wife and thoughts of self harm (that's also part of the usual PMDD), but I didn't attribute it to PMDD until last night. <newline>  <newline> Last night, I began thinking that the people, whose beliefs I genuinely backed (though I've only come around to these beliefs recently), were suddenly conspiring to trick or brainwash me and other people for whatever agenda they really had going on. I realized that was paranoia, which is now familiar to me, because I tried a new medication this year that gave me....paranoia. That's when I realized it might be PMDD. <newline>  <newline> Today, I'm scrolling through tiktok and finding everything annoying and/or boring, and I'm skipping past my favorite creators/animals. Then I again wondered if my wife and I would benefit from some time apart, and it clicked. This is my mother fuckin PMDD. Just with less anger and a new feature: ✨paranoia✨. <newline>  <newline> Part of me is glad the all consuming anger is down to like a 4 instead of a 12, but the paranoia is extremely unwelcomed, and it feels so unfair that it's here all bc I tried a new medication, so suddenly paranoia is just in my arsenal now. <newline>  <newline> Getting high has separated things a little bit, so that's nice.

1154;pjtd2i;What my recovery day looks like;I just had a few days of horrible PMS. I'm feeling more normal today, so this is what I'm doing so far to get back on track: <newline>  <newline> 1. Getting out of bed. I slept in, and watched an hour of videos, but eventually I got up.  <newline> 2. Brush teeth! Yay hygiene!  <newline> 3. Pamper face time. After days of feeling super ugly, it helped to clear out my pores and use a nice face cream.  <newline> 4. Tidy up the bedroom. My SO keeps asking if I'm depressed because of the state of it. The answer was yes. Note: Tidying up and cleaning anything smelly and gross definitely helps, but it's not going to be a heavy cleaning day.  The floors and kitchen could use a deep clean, but that can come later when I'm better recovered.  <newline> 5. Light exercise and stretching for about an hour. Super important after days of depression. I did three short videos off of youtube.  <newline> 6. Take my meds and all the vitamins. And some fiber. All the stuff I've been neglecting.  <newline> 7. Try to hydrate. I'm struggling with this right now, hopefully it gets easier.  <newline> 8. Skip coffee. I'm having some green tea. Coffee just doesn't seem like a good idea after so much anxiety.  <newline> 9. Go outside, open the curtains, get some vitamin D. I spent some time on the porch with my cat and watering plants. Also accidentally touching a lizard?  <newline> 10. Fasting. I probably won't eat until 5 or 6pm. All I wanted the past few days was carbs, and if I don't hop off the sugar train it will run me over.  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, feel free to comment about stuff you like to do on your recovery days and thanks for reading!;HermitShellville;False;1;1.0;2021-09-07 18:53:33;/r/PMDD/comments/pjtd2i/what_my_recovery_day_looks_like/;pmdd

1159;p7taz4;Less hair... Pmdd luteal phase related??;I never had hair loss issue... Im not sure if it's even hair loss or just.. Less hair and not sure if it's age related... I was breast feeding my baby for 2 whole years and then I thought maybe it's because of that.. Because I stopped and hormones where changing again but realized now that my hair around this time gets oily and has zero volume. I was born with thick hair. I always had thick black hair. I tried to do this cute hairstyle I saw on tiktok and it had zero volume it just looked terrible. I don't know how describe my hair. I DO have hair but it has zero volume and it feels thin. I always shed a lot of hair. Anyways what can I do now to increase my hair growth. Never in my life I'd have to deal with this. My hair was always freezy. I'm 34...is it age related, or luteal phase related hormones?! Will buying volumizing products help?

1161;owvdcl;Broke up with my bf mid PMDD;"I know for us gals it is difficult to distinguish what are our real feelings and what are the right decisions to make when we are in PMDD. But I had a hunch that my PMDD was the worst it has ever been because of the frustrations that came along with my relationship. When I am ""normal"" I am so tolerant, easygoing, also full of guilt, shame and remorse, and desperately wanting to be light and happy in my relationship. However, underneath my rage attacks were genuine issues that were either swept under the rug, conveniently chalked up to pmdd, or addressed but never realised. <newline>  <newline> After my last episode, which was really bad, had sent my bf several articles written for partners of women with pmdd, as well as a link to a support group for partners on Facebook. He read none of them. I found it rather disconcerting that he was so confident to put all of the blame on PMDD and yet had done ZERO research into the condition, himself. <newline>  <newline> Also I can tell the difference between PMDD rage that stems from general hypersensitivity to sounds, the need for space and to be left alone, and actual issues that would not be resolved - such as the fact he would never contribute to rent or bills, and was basically mooching off me (him being here on a tourist visa and not allowed to legally work, but would do some ""illegal"" work here and there), but always having money for alcohol and cigarettes. He would also get drunk and pester my neighbours in the middle of the night, to the point that one became physical with him, and the other one banned him from his house (both had considered him a friend).  <newline>  <newline> My rage attacks were brutal and relentless, and I take responsibility for that. I've been working my ass off trying to manage my symptoms, going from doctor to doctor, taking medication, supplements, doing vigorous exercise, not drinking booze when I'm luteal, but it finally dawned on me that my gut was screaming out every month and .y needs were being ignored. He is a manchild and I just am incapable of having a relationship with a manchild. To see him laze about on the couch, stay up until 8am watching TV only to sleep all day, get no work done, then go off drinking at 5pm whilst being seemingly happy for me to pay all of the rent and bills, is embarrassing..I feel like a fool. I am ashamed and angry. So, yes, I do believe that PMDD does give us access to our intuition and powerful overlooked needs and emotions, as difficult and painful as it may be. He had so many opportunities to improve, but he chose not to. He never once took me out on a date. Did absolutely nothing for my birthday. When I finished my incredibly stressful university degree when I was mid PMDD and the same day that lockdown lifted, he did nothing to celebrate - just moped around the house hungover because he went on a midweek bender, and when I picked a fight over this, he told me to ""leave, woman!!""  <newline>  <newline> Anyway, I honestly believe that my PMDD symptoms will decrease now that I am out of this relationship.

1165;onmxha;"Anyone tried Marea or similar ""PMS"" vitamins?";I have tried Lexapro for my PMDD and have gone on and off it a few times over the last several years and generally determine that while it works-ish, it's not my miracle thing. <newline>  <newline> Recently, I tried a month of Marea, which is one of those PMS vitamins that I've seen on Facebook ads.  Unlike some of the other PMS vitamins, this one doesn't contain anything herbal.  It does contain very heavy doses of some of the vitamins, like C and D and E and most of the B's.  My initial thought was that the overdoses of vitamins were giving me headaches (which are rare for me currently) so I thought I'd just finish it out to see but otherwise let it go after that one try. <newline>  <newline> Well, I happened to start it right before AF in May.  By the time hell week came around in June, the headaches had faded, so I guess I had adjusted?  And I realized that I hadn't had any night sweats!!!!  That's huge!  I usually soak the sheets during hell week.  I also realized that I'd barely been grumpy.  Naturally, I decided I needed to continue this experiment with Marea, but by then I'd already decided to cancel it.  And then around travel, yada yada, I ended up not restarting it until right before my July hell week (now-ish). <newline>  <newline> I'm teetering on the edge of rage all the time and hate everyone and everything that dares to exist in my space.  My normal hell moods manifest not as depression or anxiety, but as rage.  I'm still a night or two away from the usual nightsweat flood time, so hard to know if restarting it a few days again is good enough to avoid those. <newline>  <newline> For what it's worth, I was taking a multivitamin before but it had no impact on nightsweats or rage or ridiculous water retention/bloat or constipation or any my other PMDD issues.  This one seems to have had an effect pretty quickly on all of those things.  Weight stayed steady, trains kept moving, etc. <newline>  <newline> I'm definitely going to stick with taking this multi for a bit longer in a row, like 3 months at least, and then reevaluate.  Was curious if anyone else has tried something similar? <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Edited to add this link to the supplemental facts from that vitamin:  [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0120/6196/6398/files/supp\_facts\_white.png?v=1604003225](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0120/6196/6398/files/supp_facts_white.png?v=1604003225);thurnk;False;5;1.0;2021-07-19 20:50:15;/r/PMDD/comments/onmxha/anyone_tried_marea_or_similar_pms_vitamins/;pmdd

1184;ms9hbk;Something That Helps Me a lot & Might Help You too!;"So I had a little breakthrough last night and wanted to share so you could give it a shot if you're interested too. **Pepcid AC.** Overall pretty low risk and low cost. The active ingredient, [famotidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famotidine), is a [histamine H2 antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_antagonist), which blocks histamines at the receptors. Again it's pretty low-risk, since it's OTC, but here's a link to a [drug interactions checker](https://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html) and [info on precautions](https://www.webmd.com//drugs/2/drug-1821-2033/pepcid-oral/famotidine-oral/details) for anyone who may want to try it. <newline>  <newline> So here's my personal experience, if you're curious. It is hell week so please forgive that coming out in my writing haha. It's day 19 of my cycle (day 21 is usually The Bad Place and it can be worse on either side of it, depending). I've been having pretty good cycles lately but this one has already been shaping up to be a monster. Yesterday, I was having an absolute meltdown. Woke up convinced that my partner decided he hated me in the middle of the night. Having irrational anxiety about my taxes being done wrong. Huge spike in disordered eating shit and body shame. Brain feeling like pancake batter. The whole 9 yards. So I was melting and doom scrolling instagram when one of my friends with PMDD posted that they had had luck for a second cycle in a row with famotidine. They posted that it was really fast acting for them and made the biggest difference out of anything they had tried so far. I looked into it and saw that famotidine was a histamine blocker. I have already had luck treating PMDD symptoms with anti-histamines, but I'm taking an H1 blocker (generic Zyrtec). Checked drug interactions etc and found no contraindications for me. Found out I could find this at my local Target for $2.70 and thought ""fuck it, if it helps it helps, and if it doesn't, I'm out $3"" so I went and picked it up. Took it immediately in the car and in about an hour, I felt back in my body. I still felt like shit, but I no longer felt like I had pancake batter for a brain. Like that ghost driving a meat skeleton feeling of complete dissociation and inability to function that marks the really bad days was gone. I refer to how I feel on bad days as ""Gooigi"" from Luigi's Mansion 3, and it was like now I'm not gooigi, I'm regular Luigi. I wasn't like magically not depressed or anything like that, but I was much better able to function and feel into my body and sort out my thoughts. Overall, a definite win for me and I wanted to share in the hopes that it might work for someone else. I've only tried it yesterday and this morning, but it made that big of a difference for me. I will update after another cycle to let y'all know my continued experience. Again, please check drug interactions and precautions etc. before trying anything new, but it might be worth trying if you've already reacted positively to anti-histamines.";SweetIndie;False;30;1.0;2021-04-16 18:34:21;/r/PMDD/comments/ms9hbk/something_that_helps_me_a_lot_might_help_you_too/;pmdd

1187;mm1xhv;I really need a second opinion;"I feel like I can't trust myself right now. Around my period my emotions are explosive. The emotions that get the worse is my sadness, anger, and jealousy (insecurities). I get intensely more jealous. I get irrational and my emotions guide me. I need a second opinion about what happened with my boyfriend.   <newline>  <newline> For starters I'm not blaming what happened all on him. I'm at fault too and I feel horrible for the way I treated my boyfriend. I could have brought up my concern in a more light way instead of blowing up.  <newline>  <newline> So what got me into a jealous, sad, angry mood was my boyfriend posted on snapchat of him and a female coworker.This is after not responding to some of my messages or replying in short responses like ""XD"" after I replied to his message with complete sentences. It just felt like he was making her feel special and not me.  <newline>  <newline> Well I blew up about it. I tried just talking about it, but i was really upset and I when I asked him about it I was angry and upset. I was mean. And I tried to leave him.  <newline>  <newline> What led to the argument of me actually yelling at him was when I brought it up he just said things like, ""but she is my bosses daughter"" instead of saying no I don't like her. He later denys this and said he said no right at the start. It just felt like well if she wasn't a co-worker but she is, guess I can't date her. He actually was smiling throughout our argument and he even started recording me. Saying I'll see how crazy I was being.  <newline>  <newline> I just needed some reassurance that's all. He then went into saying I was being stupid for even thinking that could happen. All he did after was call me a b*tch multiple times, a crazy bitch and later he said things like at least the coworker, the one in the video at least she's not a twat and it was a vacation to be with her.  <newline>  <newline> I would like to also point out that this coworker he shared a video with is also his boss who is 1 to 2  years older than me . She is a part of nepotism because her mother was the boss and she got the job without any experience. She is also the person that my boyfroend claims to not like because of those reasons. He even talks smack about her behind her back to other co-workers. But is super friendly with her. Yes, I am the crazy one. <newline>  <newline> He also said something like the sweeter the girl the crazier she must be. At that point I was gathering my things to leave for good. He even gave me 3 minutes to start packing.  <newline>  <newline> I know we were both handing the situation wrong, but I never in the heat of any of our arguments or upsets called him names like that. I have also never made him feel jealous like he does me. It just feels like I'm not enough for him. I'm at a point where I just need to start repeatedly looking at guys while we're out. But I won't. <newline>  <newline> He later said in a phone call that I was emotionally abusing him. Because I get jealous when he posts another girl he works works with or looks at the same women in a restaurant multiple times and I out of my own insecurities will say something or get upset about it. Because I am literally in a bad place emotionally and mentally with my pms. And it brings down his vibe.  <newline>  <newline> I have been more negative lately. Not that I'm trying to use my pms as an excuse but my depression and anxiety triples around this time. He says I need to work on it. And I've tried but it feels like I'm doing it alone. Communication is very important to me so I try to talk things out with him but he just doesn't want to talk most of the time.  <newline>  <newline> Right now I don't feel like I can bring up anything to him because unless its directly affecting him (aka his vibe) he won't care.  <newline>  <newline> He wants me to be nicer to him and to work on managing my pms symptoms. He felt that I haven't been trying. Because we have arguments like this every month. Its hard to fight the chemicals in my brain. I feel like he's my enemy during this time.  <newline>  <newline> How would you have handled this situation? I know I could have not started yelling or said that I was leaving just because he didn't say the right thing. Maybe we both should've gone to separate rooms to cool down or something.";Ok-Yam7981;False;7;1.0;2021-04-07 13:21:17;/r/PMDD/comments/mm1xhv/i_really_need_a_second_opinion/;pmdd
1188;mlowfe;Trying to be a supportive husband;"Hi guys- sorry you have this issue like my wife. <newline>  <newline> my wife and I have been together for 18 years and been best friends for all that time inseparable, she always has had a bad time around a week or so before her period and its got worse over the years. finally she got diagnosed with pmdd last year and got prescription for SSRI which seemed to help. <newline>  <newline> After a year or so she seemed to be doing well on them. This January she was really horny and it was a bit out of the ordinary she was trying to jump me at any chance and somtimes a bit inappropriate , like in the kitchen when our 2 year old and 7 year old was in the other room, baring in mind she hadn't shown much interest in sex for a long time, I did question if she was feeling ok as it was out of character ad other things felt a bit odd but I convinced myself it was because she had lost 3 stone and this was a new confidence . its also important to note here that I did respond and we had sex a lot in January but then all of a sudden she switched off.  <newline>  <newline> on January 26th out of the blue she asked me in a really cold business like way ""Are you happy with us?"" I didn't know why she was asking but said ""yes of course "" <newline>  <newline> then over the next few days she told me that she was/is really unhappy/never been happy in our relationship, said I have stopped her doing things taking opportunity etc etc all the usual hell week kind of things, (I have not stopped her doing stuff and we've been a really good couple for years she was even texting me after christmas thanking me for being supportive ). She went onto say she had looked up a divorce solicitors, checked our house value, looked at houses she could rent, spoke to all her friends and colleagues about us, and they'd all questioned why she was still with me, reassuring her she should leave me( I assume she had presented them with a distorted set of facts about me). <newline>  <newline> Anyway you get the scene. what then transpired gets even more fucked up. It turns out she had downloaded a dating app just after christmas or during christmas break and had been having a lockdown affair with a guy sending video messages, pics and video calls etc this guy was a full on arsehole/playa what ever they're called, he told her exactly what she wanted to hear and must have knew what buttons to press (she says she told him she was married and unhappy) so he gave her the speel and eventually she met him in a car park and got in the back of his car, again being good at this (I suspect this isn't the first lady he has done this to) he called her and she says it was a spur of the moment thing just passing at the right time as knew where she worked and what time she finished so she says she just was a bit caught off guard and went and met him, she thought like a first date kind of thing. this all before she dropped the bomb on me about asking if I still wanted to be together. <newline>  <newline> so.. after getting in his car she says he lent into kiss her and although a little shocked she kissed him back. next is a bit hazy in detail as she cried a lot when I asked about it. Reading between the lines I think he forced himself on her and she was frozen and didn't say anything just felt confused and used. Once he finished she says he made his excuses and left, and then blocked her on the app, she didnt get his name or number it would seem. <newline>  <newline> anyway after a week of me convincing her I still loved her she agreed to give it a go albeit on a temporary trial basis. I got curious and ashamed I looked at her google history on our laptop, I was still at this point unaware of the affair and bumble app. I found on google searches for morning after pill and other stuff like vanishing messenger apps etc. certainly enough for me to get suspicious, I then found google play and saw that bumble was downloaded and I then checked her phone as it was previously not password locked, I found that it was all secure now and I couldn't get in, one night it was unlocked and I got a look, I could get into whatsapp and found some messages to an old flame of hers from years ago before we were going out so around 20 years ago (in hindsight I suspect she has been seeing him off and on over the 19 years we've been together) That night I asked her about the messages I saw ""You about today xx?"" and his reply ""no sorry babe, at work x"" <newline>  <newline> she cried her eyes out and said she was really sorry and that I don't deserve her . she said it was only messages and that she only did it because she was feeling low and knew he would respond in a sexual way and make her feel wanted. I asked about the app and she said nothing had happened on it and it had only been on a few weeks. I didn't mention the morning after pill at this point as I gave benefit of the doubt due to us having more sex in January even though I was pulling out and she's never felt the need to buy pill before (thats how we've been doing birth control for years, both lids were planned and I just left it in) <newline>  <newline> I pressed her on the old flame and she explained what had happened she said he met her at lunch time in his car and she had sex with him. she described his car and where they did it. I was now daily checking her google history and found her looking up abortion clinics. that evening we had sex and as I was about to cum she wrapped her legs around and pulled me into her deeper it definitely felt like she wanted me to leave it in, I managed to pull out anyway and then said ""that was close, unless you're already pregnant "" I wanted to give her the chance to bullshit me that it was mine as we had been having sex inJan I knew she had been looking up abortion clinic so I wanted to support her even though I was 99% sure it wasn't mine. She said she wasn't and that was that. At this point all she had admitted to was messaging the old flame. I then overheard a phone call from the abortion people, once she had finished on the call I confronted her and asked what it was about- she told me it was to talk about contraception, I at this point said ""no it isn't I know it's about an abortion "" with this she flew out the house and went to her mums. <newline>  <newline> I followed her to her mums house and we went out for a walk as she had calmed a bit. By now I knew she was pregnant and had been unfaithful both mentally and physically and was getting  an abortion . I kept asking if she had been unfaithful and was she pregnant she denied and denied it all making me feel like a shit for asking. Eventually she said it was the old flame (Richard) and that they had only met once for real the rest was 'just' messaging and that he wasn't a very nice man when she didn't do something I asked ""like what"" but never got an answer to that. We left it at that and then it was left where i had to decide if I wanted to forgive her.  <newline>  <newline> after a few days I had been thinking it over and then asked her more questions I was hurt and even more so that she may have wished her life turned out differently I even thought she meant this Richard was her one true love type of things, anyway on more discussions and pressing and questions this is when she admitted to it being bumble app man. she now changed her story and said she never met Richard but did meet bumble man, I now suspect probably both are true. anyway point being she was now extremely sorry , and guilty she had done the abortion by pills and all her guilt and self hate was wrapped up and possibly more so in that rather than being unfaithful <newline>  <newline> she then told me she hadn't taken her Sertraline since the start of december so she says although at the time she felt fine she now thinks she was in a dark place and just had all the negative parts of our relationship going around in her head. Now I find the abortion, possible rape and unfaithful behaviour is all wrapped up together and has clearly had an even more detrimental effect on her mental health that I think she has had a breakdown- she is getting mental health help but I find i cannot punish her or even discuss the infidelity as she is in such a weak mental state, she has gone back on the ssri at a higher dose as directed by GP so hopefully she is on the right track. But that leaves me in a very wierd place. I want to be here for her but at the same time I feel she must have really hated me to do that I still cannot see why she did it and how little she must think of our marriage vows. I have also been thinking very recently that if she was capable of cheating before the  what will she stop in the future . Hopefully this is ok to post and i guess I'm just looking to see if you guys can see pmdd causing this shit or is she just a cheater that happens to have her pmdd??";5w4nny;False;21;1.0;2021-04-06 23:31:09;/r/PMDD/comments/mlowfe/trying_to_be_a_supportive_husband/;pmdd
1189;mjzc0c;Got Dumped;I got broken up with yesterday morning because of my hell week last month. I said a lot of shit I didn’t mean because I felt abandoned. After I got out of my hell week he was sensitive to every little thing I did and kept claiming I was trying to make him mad or jealous. The straw that broke the camels back was me posting a video of my gay friend on my Snapchat story and him saying that I did that to intentionally make him insecure (wtf-no!i got defensive instead of validating which is my fault) I just can’t be good enough for him after my hell week no matter how much love I give and apologizing I do. He’s never done any research on the disorder, he just doesn’t get it.  He doesn’t try to work with me on my trauma reactions, he doesn’t really have thick skin (I’ve always liked how he’s sensitive though...) I just asked him “hey can you sandwich your requests for space like peer edits, like say I love you, this isn’t a huge deal but I’m a little upset. Let’s drop the subject and talk about it at this time” but he said he couldn’t do that. He gave me a list of things I needed to change about myself and everything was related to my trauma reactions and I can’t fix that shit over night. I feel like it’s my fault I’m not healed by now and I feel like I lost an amazing person because I’m not my true self half of the time. I just wish I was fucking better, right now I don’t even have the motivation to make the lifestyle changes I need to to help myself heal. I almost just want to suffer, I deserve it. Okay that’s all. I feel like shit and I’m just glad someone else out there might understand me.;bahhbahhdaze;False;5;0.84;2021-04-04 16:18:52;/r/PMDD/comments/mjzc0c/got_dumped/;pmdd
1190;mgn2d9;"Dealing with ""retroactive"" jealousy";"UPDATE: Apparently this is OCD 🙃 <newline> https://impulsetherapy.com/what-is-retroactive-jealousy-ocd/ <newline>  <newline> I think that's the right term - jealousy of my partner's past relationships. <newline>  <newline> I know a lot of it is tied into feelings of self-worth, which I'm working on with my therapist. But dear lord is it a million times harder to control during pms. I'm afraid I'm going to do something stupid like message them on Facebook - I already did other stupid things (snooping through my partner's email, googling them). It's like I become possessed with a jealousy demon and I absolutely hate it and it's not how I see myself at all.  <newline>  <newline> For context, he's my only relationship (together 3 years with no end in sight) - the most I'd done before dating him is make out with someone in a club - so pms me also gets outraged at how unfair it is. He's literally suggested me hooking up with someone else to make it ""more fair"" but I don't actually want to do that, even if pms me thinks it sounds justified. <newline>  <newline> It's such shit because it's not like he even talks to them or thinks about them - he said the only time he thinks about them is when I bring it up. Meanwhile I'm l over here triggered by every tiny thing that could be even tangentially related (names, locations, him saying he watched a movie before even though it probably wasn't with an ex but what if it was). <newline>  <newline> It's the first time in almost a year that I'm not taking serotonin-based antidepressants and I'm terrified. (On wellbutrin now but I don't think it's helping with PMDD). I'm still 10 ish days out and already the thoughts and emotions are strong. This morning I sent him nasty messages which I deleted ten minutes later. (He logs off messenger as soon as I start acting irrationally to give me time to unsend things... He doesn't have a working phone right now, luckily)  <newline>  <newline> I just really hate this part of myself and how much pain it causes all around.";zuzumix;False;13;1.0;2021-03-30 18:50:17;/r/PMDD/comments/mgn2d9/dealing_with_retroactive_jealousy/;pmdd

1192;mar2te;BC + Other Factors of Self Awareness Helping So Much;Was prescribed BC Dec 2019 but was absolutely terrified how it would affect me (previous bad experiences w/ hormonal BC) and never started.    <newline>  <newline>  <newline> Started a bit ago (microgestin 1/20 taken continuous) and now on second set of what would be hell week and it's really not bad.   <newline>  <newline> Like, is this what normal PMS is supposed to feel like?  I'm irritated by people at work but can get over it pretty quickly, I'm super tired but still got up and got to work on time and not catatonic at 3pm.  I withdrew a little this weekend just to do soothing things like watch my comfort movie and listen to comfort music but didn't sabotage any relationships.  I felt on verge of crying for no reason but no unlife ideation or full meltdown.  Can't words properly but not heavy brain fog.   <newline>  <newline> BC does not work for everyone and affects everyone differently, but if anyone, like me, was absolutely terrified to start because all the ways it could go bad, know it could also go really well!  Now I'm like, man I wish I started this so much sooner.  <newline>  <newline> &#x200B: <newline>  <newline> Other factors that helped me:     <newline> (1) Quitting addictions: Was 100% addicted to marijuana (yes folks, you CAN be addicted to marijuana, smoking occasionally is not what I'm talking about and no judgement, just for me it became a problem and physical dependence), it was making my anxiety and inability to deal with anything wayyy worse. Went on r/leaves for support.  Decreased caffeine intake to 1 cup of half caf coffee a day (gradually more scoops of decaf to caf ratio).     <newline> (2)Shitty situationship: Stopped seeing a heavily Avoidant attachment type dude that would make my mind turmoil all the time.  Haven't been single since high school.  Getting to know me on my own for first time.   <newline> (3)Neurodivergence/mental factors: With research and therapist am realizing am neurodivergent (not gonna get more specific rn), and how this affects me and my ability to process things especially during luteal and what things I use to comfort and cope.  Huge validating community on tiktok, podcasts, forums.  I think many on here have ADHD, ASD, or BPD affecting them and these things can have a huge affect on PMS/PMDD/estrogen changes.    <newline> (4) HALT - don't get too Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.  Have notifications on my phone to eat regularly (never have appetite, disordered eating) and drink water, more regular bedtime.  Take care of your physical body first or else it is guaranteed you will feel mentally like shit.   <newline>  <newline>    <newline> Just throwin my points out there on what helped me.  Vitex made me a million times worse.      <newline>  <newline>  <newline> If you're in the middle of it I'm sorry and I promise it will pass.

1193;m6roch;PMDD Whiplash;Hi all, ocd/pmdd combo sufferer here. <newline> Found Prozac, it has been super helpful but I’ve had a hard time increasing the dose because I find it too sedating/makes me buzz-y and I can’t focus on work.

One endocrinologist lady with a brilliant career behind her told me that in her entire 25 year career she only encountered 2 PMDDcases. And she shut off the conversation.

1201;lf4jkl;PMDD connection to DMER;"Delete if not allowed. Many of you will not know what DMER is, but tldr it is a physiological response to the let down during breast feeding where serotonin plummets in order for oxytocin to rise(resulting in a guaranteed 60 seconds of panic, rage, and a feeling of dread). It's a long shot, but I just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone else has a connection. I have never been diagnosed with PMDD, but my mental health has always seemed to have relied heavily on the time of month. Indeed, sometimes my anxiety and body dysmorphia flood my brain before/during my period. I relate a lot to this sub, and find it very validating to be a part of, so thank you. Since it is a hormonal thing, it occured to me the other day to ask this community in case anyone else has experienced both PMDD and DMER. Additionally, the DMER facebook group I'm in has also noted the same horrible ""panic attack feeling, rage, detachment from reality"" feeling after orgasms.

I'm really struggling w the bodybtention during my luteal phase. <newline>  <newline> I use all of the following: yin yoga, yoga Nidra, aromatherapy, self massage, therapeutic massage and reflexology, eft, reiki, Epsom salt baths, acupressure balls and self cupping and I take anti anxiety meds, cbd and opioids (have chronic pain issue), calming teas and herbal medicine from a medical herbalist.  <newline>  <newline> Is there ANYTHING else I can do? A good YouTube video... A specific stretch or coping technique??  <newline>  <newline> The neck and shoulder tension really is the worst I think it's transferring from bottom of spine to top.  <newline>  <newline> Thanks in advance;itsmariboro;False;2;1.0;2021-01-31 13:08:33;/r/PMDD/comments/l9bzdl/dealing_with_body_tension_during_luteal_phases/;pmdd
1204;ic53g5;I feel so alone;"I'm gonna try to keep this brief. I've been getting a lot better but i still have days were i struggle. I know who i am. I know i'm a lesbian. But i still panic that i'm suppressing attraction to men. even though i know im not. also worry if i saw a male celeb or a penis in person i'd be turned on by it or attracted to the male celeb even though i know i wouldnt.It's gotten so bad that when i'm checking i get really nervous and sometimes mistake it for me being turned on. Like the other day i saw this during a day i was feeling particularly anxious https://twitter.com/thisisvee__/status/1047190109853048833?lang=en and i got so nervous tingles in my lower stomach and my genitals and it honestly felt like i was turned on. i got so panicked and grossed out i felt terrible through to the next day. i also saw this https://images.app.goo.gl/iFdPvktWCBRfLkmY7 (my friend sent it to me cause she likes him but it was a slowed down version thats just the only one i could find) and i got so uncomfortable thinking about him eating me out that i got worried i was turned on cause i got tingly again. but at the same time i was thinking how gross it is. I get butterflies around men sometimes but they dont feel good at all. Ever. They just stress me out and make me feel gross. But physically they sometimes feel the same as the butterflies i get with women and i take that as proof im really attracted to men and it messes with me. Even though when i get butterflies with girls it feels good and make me happy and excited. The complete opposite from the anxious butterflies i get around men. I'm also hyper aware of how i act so i dont act ""straight"" or make people think i'm into men. I feel like i cant talk to anyone about this cause they'll just think im confused. I'm not confused i know im a lesbian. I also suffer from intrusive thoughts and that sucks as well (but they've been happening less lately) I get these butterflies even when im not checking. I'm trying to check less but i guess its always in the back of my mind cause i get these nervous flutters even when im not checking. It makes me worry i'm attracted to men when i know damn well im not. even the thought of being with a man is uncomfortable and gross to me. i could never be happy with a man. sometimes i have intrusive thoughts and i am able to just let them pass and not feel gross but sometimes they're so overly sexual they make me feel super gross. I also get tingles in my genitals if say i look at a guy's bulge and it makes me think i'm turned on but it just makes me feel super uncomfortable. I hate feeling like this. It makes me feel like i'm pretending to be a lesbian (im not) and makes me feel like i dont deserve to call myself a lesbian for feeling like this. i hate it. when i get those feelings or worries i feel guilty calling myself a lesbian. even though being a lesbian has never felt more right to me. I think thats everything but there's a lot to get through and my brain is a mess so if i think of anything else i'll either edit this post or make a new one idk i just need help/to vent <newline>  <newline>  <newline> also is it possible that butterflies can feel the same physically but different emotionally? Cause the butterflies feel the same physically sometimes around guys and girls but they make me feel very different. Butterflies with men make me feel bad and super stressed where as with women they feel really good. i also get nervous butterflies about men when im not checking. Like if i heard a guy is good in bed i might get those butterflies even though im not turned on it feels like i am. Is that normal for hocd?";afterglew;False;4;1.0;2020-08-18 17:09:56;/r/LesbianswithHOCD/comments/ic53g5/i_feel_so_alone/;lesbianswithHOCD
1205;i6fdtx;It's real.;I accepted the memories of me being attracted to men as real. I've cut the emotional connection to lesbianism. I'm pretty reassured I'm actually bisexual and could never identify as a lesbian again. I did everything I could to lose it. <newline> The only two things left are sometimes I still can't look at guys or YouTubers I'm watching because my mind says I'm attracted to them and I hate it and my intuition saying this bisexual doesn't feel right even though it seems to be technically correct and I know I don't have to date men even if I don't want to the implication that I would be interested in a man feels so wrong and yet here I was. <newline> I want to cry my eyes out but I'm numb.;throwquestionsatme;False;5;1.0;2020-08-09 07:27:32;/r/LesbianswithHOCD/comments/i6fdtx/its_real/;lesbianswithHOCD
1206;i3rhf0;Hello everyone!;"Hi everyone. I'd like to say welcome first off.  I'm in my 20's, I've had pure obsessional OCD since the age of 12 at least that's my most vivid memory. I also struggle with trichotillomania since that age as well. I have been checking my thoughts since then, I am bombarded daily with intrusive thoughts, urges and images and it has made even deciphering attraction extremely difficult. This complicates my view of myself and causes extreme distress. My teen years were filled with religious obsessions, it led to a lot of panic attacks, depression and anxiety. Slowly, the theme shifted to other things I valued. Currently it is targeting my sexuality and it has ever since I went with the lesbian label because it felt right and it proved so much about myself that I have tried to rationalize over the years.  <newline>  <newline>  If you are a member of this group, I want you to be open to doing the following things as we support one another:  <newline>  <newline> 1. Be open to a future where you do not shame yourself for your thoughts. Shame and recovery cannot co-exist.  <newline> 2. I know that most of the information out there about sexual orientation OCD is about straight people who have intrusive thoughts about being gay. When I first realized it was OCD, I felt weird,  I sobbed to my therapist telling her that I should want to be straight, it would make life easier and I feel so weird for having this. OCD doesn't care what is the norm or what would make your life easier. It cares about your values and what that currently is. Recognize that you being a lesbian that has this does not mean you are secretly in denial, it means that you value something and your OCD is targeting it.  <newline>  <newline> There are some things I want to share about my experience with OCD with a sexuality theme and what I am learning about it.  <newline>  <newline> 1. It is likely that your lesbian label has brought you some happiness, relief and freedom from having to be with men. You are terrified of that being stripped away. You're afraid of living against your own values. If you are like me, you have struggled with your sexuality, it may not have always been something you knew right away. It's been a painful journey and right when you find relief, OCD comes in.  <newline> 2. Since your lesbian label has become something that we value, OCD comes in to help us ""make sure"" we are so we don't come off as liars. This is your brain working hard to keep you safe. All the anxiety you experience comes from your brain sending you false alarms.  <newline> 3. Uncertainty has been a constant struggle for me and your journey with accepting your sexuality comes with some uncertainty. But OCD does not allow for uncertainty, it has a desire to prove that you are absolutely correct about everything all the time.  <newline>  <newline> Here are some resources that I have found very helpful. Keep in mind that excessive researching can be a compulsion so make sure to keep in mind how much you are consuming and what purpose that serves.
